We're not done yet! I'll get every last one of them!

Did it...! That's what you get for messing with humans!

Oh, a strong one. I can't wait to get a piece of it.
An Abnormal! The faster we take this thing down the better.
Are they in trouble? Seriously?!
Please don't tell me this is as bad as it looks...
Thanks for the help.
Thank you.



Yeah, whatever. Just get back to the front line!
Anytime. Give 'em hell!










Wow! Nice work!
Whoa... That...was...awesone.








Did you take out that massive one? Not bad at all.
That was a tough one, but you made it look easy.



Sorry, can I get a hand?
I wouldn't mind a helping hand about now.
I'm on my way. Just hang in there!
I'm coming!
No... Not like this.
Looks like...it's time for me to...cash in my chips.
Don't give up yet! I'm coming for you!
It's too early to call it quits! Pull yourself together!
Hey, you okay?
Are you all right?
I'm good. Let's go.
I'm all good. Let's go.
I'm gonna make you pay for this!
That's enough. I'm outta here.
Sorry to keep you, but I'm here now!

This is it! Here goes!
Whoever kills the biggest Titan wins! Okay?
It's a terrible situation, but we will turn the tables!
We can't just ignore our comrades! I'm going for them!
We'll chase you down to the ends of the earth!
I'll die defending this spot if I have to!
A retreat? I'll take the rear!
The Titans may have started all this, but we're gonna end it!
There's no time! Hurry!
Got it. Let's go!
Copy that. Let's go!
Haha, we won!
Yeah, nothing got past us!
I think they've stopped coming after us.
We won...didn't we?
We won! Humankind is victorious!
We failed the mission? Then I guess we'd better retreat.
I've still got...so much...to give.
We've got 'em on the back foot! Don't let up!
Does this mean they have the advantage...? Not good...
Let's get this mission underway.
I'm going to take the point!
I'm going to support our comrades!
Our comrades are in danger! I'm going to save them!
I have to defend this ground!
I'm teaming up.
Now's our chance to strike!
Support our comrades!
Save our comrades! Hurry!
Don't let anything get past you!
Yeah! That couldn't have gone better!
Mission failed... How humiliating.
It's impossible to carry on with the mission. Aborting.
Watch me and see how it should be done!
Has it been pointless trying to put up a fight?
