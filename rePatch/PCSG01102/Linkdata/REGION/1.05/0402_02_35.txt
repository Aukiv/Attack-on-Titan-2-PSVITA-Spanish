All done here... Onto the next fight.
We still can't afford to rest. We must move on cautiously.
That was tough...but I'm glad we got everything under control in the end.
I can't afford to fall here. I still have duties I must carry out.
A troublesome foe indeed... This will require some extra effort.
I've confirmed that this one is an Abnormal. Be careful.
Request for assistance confirmed. I'm on it.
Quite the predicament you're in... I hope I can make it in time.
Thank you very much. I won't forget this.
I apologize for causing so much trouble.
So it was you that helped me, [0:HERO_FAMN]... Thank you.
I'm glad you were there to help me, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You're very reliable.
Thank you for coming to my aid, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You gave me the strength to keep fighting.
We can't let our guard down. This isn't over yet.
Let's continue with our duties.
Thanks for the help, Miche. I knew I could count on you.
Thanks, Gelgar. I was honestly getting a little scared.
Commander, I'm sorry to cause you trouble due to my own inabilities...
I appreciate what you did, but please stay safe. Now is not the time to lose your life.
Sorry, I got caught in a tough spot... You know, you're stronger than you look.
Thank you, Miche. I'm going to hold you to that.
All I did was pay back some of what you've done for me, Gelgar.
The feeling's mutual. Now, let's finish this.


Excellent. Keep that up and don't let your guard down.
Wonderful. That will raise everyone's spirits.
Not bad, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Keep it up!
I'm impressed by your effort, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I'm expecting great things from you!
Great job, [0:HERO_FSTN]! We can overcome anything with you on our side!
You'd be just another weird old man if it weren't for your skill in battle.
You have great strength, Gelgar. I won't forget what you've done.
I don't want to make this a competition, but I don't like being outdone, either...
What a strange child, but not untalented...
...So there are talented soldiers in the Garrison Regiment, too.
You defeated an enemy that strong? You're a better fighter than I thought.
Well done... I don't think I would've been able to handle that.
Great performance, [0:HERO_FAMN]. You've improved my opinion of your abilities.
I knew you'd be up to the task, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Your skills are impeccable.
I'm glad you're here to carry out your duties, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I really mean that.
Ergh... Can I get a hand over here?
Ergh... Could someone give me some assistance?
I'm coming as fast as I can.
Understood. I'm on my way.
Dammit... I lost...
I'm sorry...but this is as far as I can go...
Hey! Soldiers shouldn't give up until the bitter end!
No! We can't lose you yet!
You still have some strength, right?
Good, it looks like you're okay.
No problem... Let's go.
No problem. I'm on my way.
Ugh... I hate to say this, but I have to retreat.
I've accomplished what was required of me... It's time for me to go.
Looks like I'm not too late... How are we doing?
Time for me to join the battle.
Commence fighting! I don't want anyone dying on me!
What's going on...? And what should I do?
It's not easy to be optimistic, but I'll do what I can.
Hurry, our comrades are in danger.
After them! If we let them escape now we'll pay for it later!
Double down on defense! The Titans can go no further!
Retreat! Some battles are best avoided... Just focus on getting out of here!
At last... My heart has been waiting for this moment!
Hurry! Time is one thing we don't have!
Got it.
Understood. Let's begin.
This time we will be victorious.
We did it... Our defenses held up.
We successfully made our retreat... Well done, everyone.
Let's call it a good fight and move on...
We won... We beat them.
It's over for us... Our mission ended in failure...
I can't believe...this is how it ends...
We won... At this rate we have a real chance!
The odds aren't good...but we can't give up.
Alright, let's make this happen.
I'll move forward.
I'll offer my support.
I'll move in for the rescue.
I'll defend this spot.
I'll team up with the others.
Forward march! We've no time to hesitate!
Provide some backup. Go!
Save our comrades!
Time for defense!
Our mission was a success, just as I expected.
The mission failed... There's nothing we can do about it.
Abort... There's no point continuing the mission now.
We can't waste this opportunity to fight!
It's as if we're being toyed with...
First a Colossal Titan, then an Armored Titan... Who or what are they...?
It's over for humanity if the Titans breach Wall Rose.
One's own safety is a secondary consideration. That's just part of being a soldier.
I know this is a lot for a new recruit, but that's how it is in times like these.
A quick response is all the more important in times of emergency.
