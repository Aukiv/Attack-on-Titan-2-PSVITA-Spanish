Keep 'em coming! I've got the blades AND the time!
That's a few more for my kill count.
Only a soldier like me could fell that beast.
Yeah! You were a pain in the ass, but you got what you deserved!
This one's no push-over... Luckily I'm not either!
It's moving so strangely! What the?!
Looks like they're up against it. I have to get over there.
That smoke signal means trouble. REAL trouble.
Tsk, thanks for that.
Thanks for your help!
Assisted by a rookie like you, [0:HERO_FAMN]?. How will I ever live this down?
I'll repay the favor, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Then we can forget this ever happened!
Oh, you again. Thanks...I guess.
You got too cocky. Watch yourself!
Please don't get yourself killed here.
I'll follow you to the bitter end, sir!
Eren? *sigh* Thanks for saving me...I suppose.
Nice assist. Glad our squad's home to capable soldiers!
Guess I slipped up, Petra. Hard to believe, I know!
Thank you, ma'am!
You're too kind, Captain!
Roger! Let's show 'em what the Levi Squad can do!
Just remember, sir-I have more confirmed kills!
Well, if that's how you thank people, maybe I should have left you for dead!
Stay alive, Moblit. We need you to help Hange with her experiments-so we don't have to!
You're not quite up to my standard, but you've got some skills!
Wow! I have to up my game.
So you can fight, eh? I better not catch you getting an attitude!
Those are some skills, [0:HERO_FSTN]. A bit more and you'll be neck and neck with me.
Join me, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Together, we'll rival even the captain!
Astounding, sir! It's an honor to serve under you!
All thanks to my superb mentoring, of course.
And that's why WE'RE in charge of Special Ops!
Well played, Petra! I could've done better, but well played!
Character aside, that's a soldier with some mean talent.
Looks like my role's been usurped. Still...there's always next time.
I doubt even I could've done that.
Don't get the wrong idea, [0:HERO_FAMN]. I practically gave that kill to you.
Geez, [0:HERO_FSTN]. We're fighting monsters-it's okay to be afraid!
Together, [0:HERO_FSTN], we can topple any Titan they throw at us!
A little help, please!
You're just in time. Let's team up!
Leave it to me! Get yourself together!
Got it!
Crap... This can't be happening to me!
Sorry... I need...help.
I ain't letting you die!
Don't go giving up on me!
So you're still alive. Are you okay?
Oh, how are you?
I'm fine! Just worry about yourself!
I'm good. I've still got a lot more fight in me!
You've gotta be kidding me. I'd better retreat.
I can't carry on anymore. I'm gonna fall back.
Make way for the cavalry!
Now you've gotta face me, you stinking Titans!
Let's show the Titans what we're made of!
I've got the most kills in the team...and I'm gonna show you why!
Ugh. How do they expect us to turn THIS around?
Our comrades are in danger. We can't just leave them.
Don't let 'em get away!
I have to defend this area against whatever comes my way.
If we don't have to fight-we shouldn't. Simple as that. Now...RETREAT!
If we don't win this, everything we've done so far will have been for nothing!
Move your asses! We're almost out of time!
Don't let your guard down!
Let's do this!
See that? I cut those freaks goooood!
I don't know if it was enough, but we held our ground.
That's it. We got away.
How could we be satisfied with this?
How do ya like that?! We thrashed you!
There's no coming back now that this mission has gone to hell!
It's the end of the line for me... Go. Get outta here.
Say hello to the Scouts, you piece o'...!
They're all over us!
Let's get this mission underway!
Advancing!
Tsk, am I gonna have to provide support?
Hang on! Help's on the way!
I've got this. Nothing's gonna get past me!
Hey, I'm teaming up.
Don't think about it, just advance!
Provide support! Got it?!
I need you to save our comrades.
Don't let a single one get past you!
We did it! How do ya like that, you hulking great bastards?!
We failed?! You've gotta be kidding me!
We haven't got a cat in hell's chance now! Cancel the mission!
When the going gets tough, the tough get going!
Why...? Haven't I got what it takes?
A recruit's done his job when he makes it back. The battle isn't over 'til you get home, you know?
I say leave the nasty Titans to us. The other squads should focus on staying alive.
I alone know what's going on inside the Commander's head.
I can't just stand by and let those Titan bastards have their way!
We're all just doing our jobs. That's it.
