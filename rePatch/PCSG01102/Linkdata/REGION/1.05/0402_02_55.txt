I don't know what we're gonna do when the Titans attack...





Hey, what does that smoke mean?
It looks like they're in trouble. Shouldn't you help them?
Thanks for the help.

Thank you. I owe you my life.














You're really something!

You're strong for your age!


If you've survived in the Scout Regiment this long, you've gotta be pretty strong.




You killed that Titan?! I'm astonished.

You took that Titan down?! Wow...you're really strong!


















I wanna see you give it everything you've got!










We won! Well done!








Starting the mission!





Move forward, please!
You'd better support your comrades.
Your comrades are in danger! Help them!
Please make sure you defend that area.
That went well. What a relief!
That didn't work? Oh, no...
It's useless, let's abort the mission already.


Think they're gonna attack us here, too...?
I don't know what we're gonna do when the Titans attack...
