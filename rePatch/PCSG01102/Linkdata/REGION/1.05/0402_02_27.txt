Look who can still give a good fight on the front lines!
I just do the work given to me.
If that Titan made it into one of the towns, or worse-the capital-it would've been sheer chaos.
Don't underestimate the combat strength of the Military Police Regiment!
Facing off with this thing wouldn't be my smartest decision today...
There's something strange about that Titan! Is it an Abnormal?
A distress call! We have to get over there!
See that smoke signal? They're getting dismantled over there!
Thanks for the help.
You saved my life.
Thanks, [0:HERO_FAMN]. I might've been in pieces if you weren't close by.
Am I lucky you're here, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Must be that sixth sense of yours!
Glad to see you, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You saved our asses...again!
Be more careful next time.
I'm just glad you're okay.
Now this takes me back. Reminds me of our cadet days.
Thanks. We might not agree on everything, but...thanks.
I'm glad we have such a promising recruit in our ranks.
Premier?! My sincerest gratitude! ...And apologies for the trouble.

The Military Police is busy as it is, Elwin. Try not to increase our workload.
If you bit the dust, who would be left to spearhead Elwin's foolish gambles?
And I heard you were hoping to become Military Police brass. Dying here won't help, you know?
You're mumbling-I can't hear you. But whatever. You're safe.
Yes, sir! I will continue to uphold this great regiment's ideals!
Great work! Keep it up!
We'll try to follow your example!
A textbook kill, [0:HERO_FAMN]. You took your time in the Cadet Corps seriously.
Nice fluid movements. You're no stranger to the battlefield, [0:HERO_FSTN].
Having you in the Military Police would really energize our ranks, [0:HERO_FSTN].
Strong as ever, Elwin.
Where did Elwin FIND this guy?
Beautiful. Remember that maneuver, no matter how high in the ranks you get.
A truly magnificent display, Premier!
He moves like lightning-and at that age. He must have been a beast in his youth.
How could anyone kill a Titan like that?!
We beat that Titan and the rest will take care of itself!
You're no ordinary recruit, [0:HERO_FAMN]. You have a great future ahead of you.
You didn't even flinch, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You've got the makings of a true hero.
What are you-invincible? The interior is safe with you on the watch, [0:HERO_FSTN]!
It's too much for me! I need help!
I need support over here! It's more than I can handle!
I've kind of got my plate full over here already guys!
I'm coming to help!
What are you doing?! I need help!
Am I going to die without seeing my family ever again?
Human life is the top priority! I'm coming!
I'll be there ASAP!
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
I'm all right.
I'm fine.
I must survive...for my family.
Our part in this mission is over. Retreating!
What's the situation? ...Ah. Not favorable, I see.
Leave the rest to the Military Police.
We will accomplish this mission! Advance!
For the glory of the Military Police! We won't be outdone by the Scout Regiment!
Remember your families! We finish the mission-we go home!
The Titans are not important! Rescuing our comrades is the highest priority!
The Titans are getting away! Run them down and destroy them!
Defend this area from the Titans. That is our mission.
All units, retreat as fast as you can!
Victory for humankind is our ultimate objective.
All units, get this mission over with ASAP!
Okay, here goes!
Yes, ready for action!
Mission complete. Good work, soldiers!
We held the Titans at bay! Mission complete!
They've stopped chasing us. Withdrawal complete!
We did our best. There's nothing for us to be ashamed of.
Now the monarchy's place should be assured.
We failed the mission? So more lives have been lost for nothing.
If I die...what will become of my family?
There aren't many Titans left. Humanity may still have a chance yet.
Continuing to fight will only lead to more deaths.
Time to put this campaign into action!
Advancing towards our objective!
I'm going to support our comrades!
Right now, saving our comrades is our top priority!
I will halt the Titans!
Teaming up!
Advance!
Support our comrades!
Save our comrades!
Hold back the Titans!
Nice work, boys. Mission accomplished.
We failed? How could that be?!
We're out of options. Aborting mission!
For my family, I will not die today!
Did I join the Military Police only to become Titan food?
The Military Police protects the peace within the walls. Though, it's not without its flaws...
My third child is on the way. I can't wait.
I do the work I'm given. That is all.
Mary, my children... They're my pride and joy.
Whatever path we choose, we still have to obey orders from above.
