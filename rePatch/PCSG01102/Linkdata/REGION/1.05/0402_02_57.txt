I wonder what it's like outside the Walls...





What's that smoke? It doesn't look good.
Hey, hurry! Help them!
Thanks! I'm so happy!

I'll never forget this!














Awesome!

You're the best!


I wanna fight like you someday!




I-I wasn't scared. I knew you'd kill it!

Wow! I'm not scared of Titans anymore now that you're here!


















Fight! Don't lose!










We won! We won!








I can do it!





Advance, but be careful.
Shouldn't you all help each other?
Someone's in danger! Please, help them!
Defend that area! Please!
It went well, didn't it? Great.
No, we failed.
No! We have to stop!


I'm gonna become a big, strong soldier someday and kick those Titans' butts!
