If they breach the Wall, we will all be...





Hey, that looks like a smoke signal over there.
That smoke signal... Things must be pretty bad.
Thanks.

If it weren't for you, I...I...














Pretty good.

I'm glad I can rely on soldiers like you...


An elite soldier from the Scout Regiment? What a relief to have you here...




Wow, I didn't think anyone could kill a Titan like that.

You're strong...like, really strong!


















Please protect us!










Yeah! We won!








We've got a few tricks up our sleeve!





I need you to advance.
Go and support your comrades.
Our comrades are in danger! They need help!
You have to defend that area! Please!
Yeah, mission accomplished!
Damn, you screwed it up!
I guess there's no way to carry on.


Does humanity have any hope...?
If they breach the Wall, we will all be...
