Not yet ...Let's get rid of every one of them!
Humankind is striking back!
It's our turn to devour THEM!
Did you see that?! This is the strength of humankind!
This one looks like it's gonna be a tough customer.
Abnormal sighted! Take care of it!
It's a distress call!
Smoke signal sighted! Can we reach them in time?!
Thanks!
Thank you!
Thanks, [0:HERO_FAMN]. That was too close for comfort.
Saved my skin again, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I owe you one.
I knew you had my back, [0:HERO_FSTN]! We're an invincible duo!
Stay frosty! The danger hasn't passed yet!
Keep it together! We're not done yet!
You really save my hide, Mikasa...again.
Armin, I swear you look out for me more than yourself! ...Thanks.
Wow, Jean. You saved me there... Appreciate it.
Thanks for the assistance, Captain! I'm indebted.
Sorry for the trouble, Mr. Hannes. I'm still kicking thanks to you.
Hey, I gotta give back sometime, you know?
On the contrary, Armin-you're always there for ME.
I'd swear that nickname suits you more these days. Now let's finish this!
Nice one, Reiner! Let's put the boot to these freaks!
Don't mention it. Five years ago, you did the same for me.
Sheesh, you're making me look bad!
Incredible. It's like watching a human blur!
I see you've got some moves, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
Nice one, [0:HERO_FSTN]! You know how to put 'em down!
Geez, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Remind me not to piss you off!
Mikasa's fast. Real fast. I'd better step my game up too!
Wow, Armin! Keep it up! I'm counting on you, buddy!
Jean's improved by leaps and bounds. I'd better kick it up a notch myself!
Captain Levi's on a level all his own.
Out of this world! Maybe the weirder you are...the stronger?
Oh! You beat me to it!
That was so fast... I dunno how you did it.
Nice, [0:HERO_FAMN]! I guess no Titan's too tall for you!
You're something else, [0:HERO_FSTN]. That one was a doozie!
Good work, [0:HERO_FSTN]-but I know you're capable of more!
Hey, a little help over here!
I need backup!
I'm on my way!
Got it! I'm coming!
Damn. Things won't end well at this rate!
I'm not getting out of this alive... I need reinforcements!
Ugh, I'm coming! Hold on!
Not good. I'd better get over there-pronto!
Hey, you okay?
Are you okay?!
Good, you're still in one piece.
I'm fine. Let's go!
Damn... Fall back!
It's about time I got outta here.
I made it in time! I've got this!
Eren Jaeger, joining the fight!
Ready for battle!
Let's see who can kill the most Titans!
I didn't come here to give up. I came here to FIGHT!
Hang in there! I'll save you!
You aren't getting away from me!
Whatever happens, they won't get through me!
This is bad. We need to make a run for it!
Eliminate every last one of them! Freedom is ours for the taking!
We haven't got much time! Get a move on!
Okay, let's go!
I'm right behind you!
Get it now?! This is how strong humankind is!
Yeah, we held our ground!
Phew. A safe escape.
The Titans are leaving... Have we won?
We won... Humankind has defeated the Titans!
That's the sign for a full retreat. Did the operation fail?
I can't die like this!
We've got the upper hand! Victory's almost ours!
Damn, they're being overwhelmed.
Okay, let's get the mission started!
We have to advance!
I'm going to support our comrades!
I'll never abandon my comrades!
I'll stand my ground! Not a single one will get past me!
Looks like I'd better meet up with the others.
Now's our chance! Charge!
Provide some backup. Go!
We have to save them! Help me!
I'm counting on you to defend the area!
Yeah, mission complete!
No... We failed.
We can't carry on the mission now.
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Are we done for?!
Kill or be killed. Fight for your life-it's the only way.
I'm going to drive out every last Titan and leave these cramped walls! That's my dream!
I wanna slaughter every Titan that crosses my path.
If there's nobody around to carry on anymore, then all the lives of the people who've died so far would become meaningless!
Living inside the Walls is just like being livestock, isn't it?
