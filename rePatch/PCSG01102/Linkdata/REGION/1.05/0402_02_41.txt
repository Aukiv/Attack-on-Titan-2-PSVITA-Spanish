I did it...! I beat one, too!

D-did I really just do that...?

Wh-what's that?! I've never seen anything like it!
What the...? We've got an Abnormal on our hands.
Is that a distress call? We can't just ignore it.
This looks bad... I'm going in!
Th-thanks. I thought I was history for a moment there.
Thank you for your help!



Don't mention it. Let's make it through this.
It was nothing. I'm just glad you're okay.










Hey, not bad.
Wow... Spectacular.








Wh-when did you get so strong?
Amazing... I'm lucky to be able to fight alongside you.



I've had it. Help me out!
They're all over me! Please help!
Are you okay?! I'm coming!
Erm... I guess It's up to me.
A-am I gonna die? Please...no!
I'm done for. Someone...help...
Hey! Pull yourself together!
Come on. Pull yourself together!
Huh?! It's you. Are you okay?
A-are you okay?
Yeah... Looks like I'm still in one piece.
I'm fine.
I don't wanna die! I'm getting outta here!
That's enough for now. Retreating!
Huh? Haven't you won yet?

I guess I don't have a choice. Let's get this over and done with!
Everybody, go for the win! Me? I'm happy to be referee.
This is really not the kind of situation you wanna be in...
I know it's scary...but we can't just abandon our comrades.
Here goes! I'm coming for you!
I have to hold this ground.
Run away! Fast as you can!
This is our chance to end this once and for all, isn't it?
Move it! We ain't got time to hang around!
Got it!
Okay! I'll be right behind you!
We did it! Cool!
Hahaha! See that? I held my ground.
We got away... Staying alive is victory enough for me!
I'm gonna forget any of this ever happened!
We won! We won! We won!
Carrying on the mission would be pointless.
No...No... I don't...wanna...die.
Nice! Let's finish them off!
I've got a bad feeling about this.
I guess we'd better get cracking with our mission.
There's nothing else left but the task before us! Here goes!
I'll go and support our comrades.
It's not as if we can just abandon them!
I guess it's up to me to hold this ground.
Where can I find one of my comrades? I need to join up with someone.
Cha... Charge!
Support our comrades!
I need you to save our comrades!
Protect that area! Got it?!
We did it! Mission accomplished!
No, we failed...
It's no good. We have to abort the mission.
Let me at 'em! I can do it!
We're done. We don't stand a chance of winning.
