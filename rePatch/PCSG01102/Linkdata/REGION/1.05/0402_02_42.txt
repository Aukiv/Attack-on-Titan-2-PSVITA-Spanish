Don't mess with me, you stupid Titan!

That should do it, you big blockhead...

This one looks like it's gonna be a challenge. I'm itching to get a piece of it!
It's an Abnormal! Be careful!
A distress call?! Hang in there!
Looks pretty bad... I'd better hurry!
Thanks. I needed that!
Thanks for the help!



Don't mention it. Let's get back into this fight!
Hehe, you can leave the rest to me!










Nicely done! Looks like I need to up my game!
Awesome! Nothing I can't do!








Oh! I thought I'd be the one to take it down!
Amazing... I hope I can be that strong someday...



I messed up! Help!
Sorry, but could you lend a hand?!
What were you thinking?! Hold on!
I hear ya. I'll be right there!
How could I...get myself...into such a mess?
Can I send a distress call?
Don't give up yet! I'm coming to help!
I'm coming! Hang in there!
Oh? You okay?
Are you all right?
I'll live. How about you?
I'm okay! Let's go!
Me? Running away? What a disgrace!
I'm sure no one will object if I withdraw soon.
Sorry to keep you waiting! Leave the rest to me!

I can't wait to get in the thick of it!
You can all keep count of my kills for me!
The odds are stacked against us. Hehe, exciting, isn't it?!
I'm not letting them die! Let's go!
You're not getting away that easily!
A defensive battle? It's not really my strong point.
Relax! I'll get you all out of here in one piece!
It's crunch time. Let's do this thing!
Short and sweet! Just how I like it!
Leave it to me!
Understood! I've got this!
Yeah! We did it!
Phew, we managed to hold them off.
We made it. Is everyone okay?
Damn! We won, but this just doesn't feel right!
We did it! We beat the Titans!
How could we have failed? I've still got some fight left in me!
I'm done... I've given all I had.
We're on a roll! This is in the bag!
They're overwhelming us! Can we turn this around?!
Yeah, time to have me some fun!
Commencing the advance! Follow me!
I think I'd better support our comrades.
Our comrades need help! Hurry!
I hope I can keep them at bay.
Maybe it's time to join forces.
Don't be afraid! Charge!
Go and support our comrades!
Our comrades need help! Hurry!
Defend that area! I'm counting on you!
See that?! Mission complete!
We failed? Disgraceful.
I don't like giving up...but we have no choice but to abort.
I feel so alive! Let me at 'em!
Ugh, why can't I focus...?
