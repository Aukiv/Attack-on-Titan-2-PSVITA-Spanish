Done and DONE!
There's no way I'm letting the Titans snack on me.
That Titan didn't know when to quit. Still canned him though!
That was tough. Luckily I didn't end up a martyr to the Corps.
It looks like we have a ferocious Titan on our hands.
Damn, it's an Abnormal.
That smoke signal... Looks like they need help.
We need to get a move on and help them.
Thanks.
I'm most grateful.
Hey, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Right on time, I see!
Sorry for the trouble, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I almost got flattened there.
There you are, [0:HERO_FSTN]-our hero! ...Huh? I AM being sincere, really!
I assume you'll repay the favor?
It's my job.
Thanks, Reiner. But I'm still not handing Christa over!
That you, Bertholdt? Talk about unexpected twists!
I knew you'd come, Christa! After all, you're too nice for your own good!
You owe me, so keep those favors coming!
Saved by the runt. Oh, how far I've fallen...
Yeah, not sure why I saved you either. Guess I felt like it?
And with that-I declare you my butler! Mwahaha!
Whew! Christa's safe-that's all I need.
I saved your freaking life, you know? I'd better be seeing gratitude in spades.
So what? Sometimes I feel generous.
Wow, I hope you can use that skill to lighten my workload.
We rookies can't compare to you.
That's some killer instinct, [0:HERO_FAMN].
Not bad, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You've got potential!
Stunning, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Wish I could take the credit!
That's my Christa for you! Marry me if we make it back!
Eh, not bad, considering you're so...vertically challenged.
Smooth, Reiner! Now fell a few more Titans for me, would you?
Geez, Bertholdt. If you can fight like that, why are you always such a wimp?
Mikasa. I gotta ask. You ARE human, right? Not some beast-thing?
Now that you've got rid of that thorn in our sides, things should get a lot easier for us!
Nice one! If you don't mind...could you get rid of the other scary ones too?
Quite the juggernaut today, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Looks can deceive, I guess.
My, you're vicious [0:HERO_FSTN]. Now take down the rest of them down, would you?
Is that dead Titan your handiwork, [0:HERO_FSTN]? ...Yeah, thought so.
Uh, a little help?!
I need reinforcements, now!
Yeah, I'm coming.
Got it. On my way.
I don't want to die! Someone, help!
Urgh, a little help here!
I'll be right there!
I need to move fast!
Hey, are you still alive?
You okay?
Looks like your number's not up quite yet.
I'm fine. Let's go.
Urgh, I can't fight anymore. I'm gonna fall back.
We did well enough. Now it's time to bail.
What, isn't it over yet?
Hehe, looks like I made it in time.
Here we go then.
Give it everything you've got, except me of course!
I can fight too, you know? When the chips are down, at least.
It's our mission to help them.
Do we really have to chase after them?
We have to hold on, no matter what.
I'm getting the hell out of here!
I must stay focused and end this once and for all.
There's no time to waste. Let's finish this ASAP.
Okay, I'm in.
I'm right behind you guys!
We won. Can I go now?
Oh, we held our ground.
Yay, we got away.
Just be glad we're alive.
So humankind has prevailed? That's great.
Mission failed. I'm off.
Damn... I can't believe it.
Yeah, they don't stand a chance!
What's this? They're all over us.
Shall we get down to business?
I should probably advance.
They could do with some support.
If we help them, they'll have to do something for us in return.
Maybe we'll get a reward if we hold them off?
We should meet up with the others.
Advance.
Support them.
Go and help.
So defending this area is our top priority?
Well that mission went pretty well.
It appears that we've failed.
There's no pulling this one back. We have to abort.
I'm going to survive, no matter what happens!
I'm fed up of working for other people.
I'll live the life with this name! It'll be grand! Call it...my personal vengeance.
Christa's like me... A lot like me, in fact.
I throw Sasha some bread and get a servant in return? Now that's what I call a deal, haha!
I wonder if Titans would skip over the jaded, unmotivated soldiers-mistake them for corpses or something.
I'm fed up of living for other people. I want everything I do to be for myself.
