Don't let up! Push right through!
I did it...but there's no time to celebrate.
That was a tough one, but I wore him down!
I never want to meet one like that again.
The odds don't look good, but we have to fight!
Be careful! It's an Abnormal!
It's a distress call!
That smoke signal! What's happening?!
Thanks.
Thank you.
You're a recruit, right? [0:HERO_FAMN], was it? Thanks for the save.
Expect your next assist to come from me, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Thanks.
Thanks as always, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You're my hero.
It was nothing.
Don't mention it. Now let's clean up the remaining Titans.
You know what I think, Eren? You're worth us staking our lives.
Thanks. But next time, don't worry about me. We need you at your best, without distractions.
Sorry about that. The way I'm fighting, maybe I shouldn't be giving orders, ha!
Sorry to drag you this far into the front lines, sir!

Right back at you, Rico. The next time I slip up, I'll be expecting you to come running!
No prob, Mitabi. You saved me last time, so now we're even.
If I may object sir, nothing is more integral to this regiment than your ingenuity and judgment.
Please leave the heavy lifting to us, sir!

Great work!
Amazing!
Good going, [0:HERO_FAMN]. I like your enthusiasm!
Nicely done, [0:HERO_FSTN]. The Garrison Regiment could use a soldier like you.
You're too good, [0:HERO_FSTN]. We elites don't have anything left to kill!
I can't wait to see what you've got up your sleeve next, Eren.
You're a damned fighting genius, Ackermann! I shudder to think what your childhood was like.
We elites are an example to other soldiers. We need to stay at the top.
You handle yourself on the front lines like an elite, Commander.
Captain Woermann glides like a bird. There's still much we can learn from him.
Killing a Titan like that...?! How could one person be so powerful?
A perfect demonstration of how to bring down a Titan.
I thought you were being reckless, but it looks like you knew what you were doing, [0:HERO_FAMN].
You obliterated that Titan, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You're practically an elite.
Together with you, there's no Titan we can't topple.
Someone, lend a hand!
I need support over here!
I'll be right there!
Copy that! I'm coming for you!
I'll resist...until...the very end.
I'm prepared...to lay down...my life.
Don't give up. I won't abandon you.
There's no time to lose! I have to hurry!
Can you still fight?
Are you okay?
The question is, can you still fight?
Hah, I can still fight!
Take care of the rest, guys...
That's it. I'm retreating.
Ian Dietrich here, ready for battle!
Joining the fight!
This is it! Advance!
Let's take care of these Titans and then go for a drink!
We allowed this situation to arise.
Hang on! The Elite Squad will save you!
The Titans are getting away! Chase them down and destroy them!
No matter how many of us lose our lives, we will defend this area!
The Titans are closing in! Fall back!
For the future of mankind, advance!
There's no time to think about it! Just push on!
Right, let's go!
Understood!
We won!
You persevered, team. Mission successful.
It was close, but we got away.
The battle's over...but I'm not thrilled with the outcome.
Victory for mankind. So this day has finally arrived.
We failed the mission?! That's it then, all units fall back!
Mankind no longer has a hope of victory.
Keep up the momentum!
However you look at it, the Titans are overwhelming us.
Time to get this campaign underway!
I'll take point!
Leave the support to me!
I'll save our comrades!
I will halt the Titans!
I'm teaming up.
Advance!
Provide support!
Save our comrades! Don't let them die!
Focus all your efforts on defense!
Mission accomplished!
They took us to town. Mission failed.
The mission is inviable! Aborting!
I'll carry on resisting until the very end.
No matter how hard we fight, humanity can never resist the Titans.
Know what they call us? The "elite of elites." Our performance must be worthy of that mantle.
If there's even a fraction of a chance that humanity can beat back the Titans...I'm willing to stake everything on it.
The Garrison Regiment exists to protect towns caught on the front lines.
I wanna get this over with and then have a nice drink.
I pour my heart and soul into each and every mission.
