On to the next target.
Humanity will never yield to the Titans!
That was a strong one.
This is a significant achievement.
That Titan... We must be careful.
An Abnormal. We mustn't ignore this.
That smoke signal... It's a distress call.
We must hurry to their aid before it's too late.
Thanks for your help.
Thank you for your help.
You saved me, [0:HERO_FAMN]. I am indebted.
Thanks, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I see great things in store for you.
To my rescue again, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Your courage is worthy of my gratitude and respect.
You have but one heart. When you die-make it count.
I'm happy to repay you for all the times you've helped me. Stay safe.
My thanks, Levi. I was careless there.
Thanks. It seems I'm always being saved by you.
Thank you, Nile. You and your Military Police are boons to humanity.
My deepest thanks, Premier-and apologies. I did not mean to trouble you so.
Thanks, Instructor. Were it not for you, I would have met my end.
Think nothing of it. I needed the practice anyway.
It's no trouble at all, Hange. Plus, I get to show you I'm not past my prime.
Your generation is the Scout Regiment's future. It's far too early for you to die.
We're busy as it is, Premier. We can't be taking on your duties as well.
It does bring back memories. As I recall, you saved me back then too.
Good work. Keep it up and see this mission through.
Absolutely splendid.
Good form today, [0:HERO_FAMN].
Impressive, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Your skills have been duly noted.
I'm honored to have a soldier such as yourself in my regiment, [0:HERO_FSTN].
I knew you'd come through, Levi. You always have.
Exemplary work, Hange. With you here, the Scouts are sure to endure.
Your greatest strength is your experience, Miche.
Incredible. It would seem the years have only honed your skills further.
What a show of battle prowess by the Garrison Regiment elites. Their skills rival our own.
Excellent work! That Titan's defeat is a major boost to our campaign.
I'm astonished that you managed to defeat such a powerful Titan!
Thank you for that display. You show much promise.
You felled quite a dangerous foe, [0:HERO_FSTN]. My compliments.
I foresee you will someday become a leading presence in this regiment, [0:HERO_FSTN].
Someone... I need help!
I need reinforcements over here!
Hang in there. I'm on my way!
I'll be right there. Just hold on.
No... I'm done for... Somebody, help!
I am outmatched. Requesting assistance!
Just hang on! I won't let you die!
Understood! I won't give up on you!
How are you? Can you still fight?
You don't look wounded.
I'm still standing. Let's go.
I'm okay. Let's move out.
I mustn't die in vain. Retreat!
There's no point fighting on. I'm withdrawing.
I'm here to support you!
I'm here to bolster the front line!
All units, engage!
All units, spread out! Engage at will!
Attack! Turn the tables and seize victory!
Our objective isn't to fight the Titans! Our priority is saving our comrades! Go!
Suppress the Titans! All units, don't let up!
Meet them head-on! Put a stop to the Titans' advance!
All units, fall back! Secure our retreat!
This moment will determine the future of all humankind! Give it everything you've got!
We don't have any more time! Get this mission done!
I'm in!
Understood. Engaging!
This brings mankind one step closer to victory.
Well done. Without your resilience, the Titans would have undoubtedly broken through.
Safe at last. Commendable work, everyone.
It looks like the danger has passed, but what are we to make of this situation?
This victory marks another step forward for the whole of mankind! Well done, soldiers!
The day is lost. All units-retreat!
This gamble didn't pay off.
We're dominating the battlefield! Don't let up!
This is a troubling state of affairs.
Let's get this show on the road!
Let's advance.
I'm bringing support.
I'll save them.
I'll stand my ground for as long as there's breath in my body.
I need to team up.
Advance!
Back them up!
Save them!
Hold strong!
Excellent, mission complete.
Mission failed.
There's nothing else we can do. Abort mission!
The future of humanity hangs on the outcome of this battle!
I can't allow any more soldiers to die!
Our struggle will determine mankind's very fate.
Venturing into the territory of humankind's greatest foe-such is the duty of our regiment.
Humanity's progress is paved with the corpses of those who came before us.
We must be prepared to lose everything in this fight. Only then do we have a chance of victory.
It is imperative we unravel the mystery of the Titans.
