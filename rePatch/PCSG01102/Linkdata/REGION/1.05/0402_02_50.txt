As long as everything's safe within the Walls...





What is that smoke? Is it some kind of signal?
Hey, are you all right? It looks like you're in something of a rocky situation.
Oh...ahem... Thank you.

Ah, forgive me.














Not bad at all.

You have strength beyond your years, child.


Was that Commander Erwin...? I suppose the Scout Regiment has its uses after all.




You defeated such a beast?! I'm flabbergasted.

You b-beat that thing...?! W-w-well done!


















Hurry up and obliterate the enemy!










Victory! Well done, everybody!








Don't think we'll let those vile Titans get away with making fools of us!





Advance! Let me see you earn your pay!
Aren't you going to support your comrades?!
Save your comrades! Hurry!
Whatever happens, you must not let this ground fall into enemy hands!
It appears the mission has been a resounding success.
Mission failed?! What is the meaning of this?!
How do you expect to continue the mission now?! Abort! Abort!


I suppose investing in the Scout Regiment isn't without its merits...
As long as everything's safe within the Walls...
