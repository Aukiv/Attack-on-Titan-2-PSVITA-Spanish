Even if we manage to survive, how are we supposed to keep living like this...?





That smoke... Isn't that your comrades calling for you?
Hey! Your friends are in danger!
Thanks for that!

You saved me! I'd be dead if it weren't for you!














Woah! You're awesome!

You know how to get things done!


Even young soldiers are doing their best to fight...




I'm lost for words... I can't believe you beat that thing.

Woah, you did it! You actually beat that thing!


















Tear those Titans a new one!










Yeah, we won!








Starting the mission!





Advance! Watch yourselves!
Go and support your comrades.
Go and help your comrades.
Defend that area for me, will ya?
Oh yeah! Mission complete!
Mission failed? Isn't there any way to sort this out?
There's no way we can carry on with this. Aborting mission!


I don't wanna even think about getting eaten alive...
Even if we manage to survive, how are we supposed to keep living like this...?
