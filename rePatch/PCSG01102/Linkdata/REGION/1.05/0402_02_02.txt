I will fight...and win.
My specialty is tearing through flesh.
Who wants to get minced? Step right up.
Don't even think about showing up again.
No matter the enemy, I'll take it down.
An Abnormal!
A distress call!
They need help. There's not a moment to spare!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sorry, [0:HERO_FAMN]. I put you in danger.
I'm alive because of you, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Thanks.
Thanks, [0:HERO_FSTN]. With you here, I feel like I can see this through.
Are you all right? If so, join me and fight.
I'm just glad I made it in time.
You saved me again, Eren.
Thanks, Armin. Watch your own back, too.
I owe you, Jean. Now I can fight again.
Appreciate it, Sasha. Hey, I'll pass you some of my rations later.
You came for me, Mr. Hannes. Thank you.
Stay close to me, Eren. I need you to live a long life.
Don't mention it, Armin. I need you to watch out for me too.
Glad you're safe. Now-we have a battle to win.
Get up if you're not injured. Move your body-not your mouth!
You know, not once did I dream we'd be fighting side-by-side.
Nice moves. Keep it up!
Amazing. I'll have to try that.
That's the way, [0:HERO_FAMN]! I'd better keep up.
Nice moves as always, [0:HERO_FSTN].
With you here, [0:HERO_FSTN], I can devote myself to the fight.
Amazing, Eren. Just stay out of harm's way, okay?
Looking good, Armin! But remember to play it safe.
I see you're in high spirits, Jean. Do keep tabs on your remaining gas and blades.
Now that's speed! I'm not even sure I could keep up.
Annie's strong. Crazy strong.
You killed that Titan? We can win this!
Extraordinary... You defeated it.
Looking good, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Keep it up!
Wow, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Guess you never needed me.
I knew you'd come through, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You always do.
Argh... This is bad.
I can still fight!
Hold on! I'm on my way!
Hang on! I'll be right there!
Somebody...help!
I can't...hang on...
I won't let you die!
I can make it! I have to help!
How's it going?
How are you doing?
I'm fine. There are still more Titans to kill. Let's go.
I'm good to go anytime.
I can't fight any longer.
It would be pointless to carry on fighting.
All is not lost. Victory will be ours!
I'm here!
Bring it.
That pipsqueak took things way too far. I will make him pay!
If we want to turn this situation around, we have no choice but to fight.
There's still hope. We must save them.
I'm not letting you get away!
I won't let anything get past me.
We have to withdraw. Staying to fight will only lead to more losses.
We're going to finish this!
Get a move on or we won't make it.
We cannot allow ourselves to be defeated.
Ready for battle!
We won...and I'm still breathing!
We held them at bay.
We're home free. Is everyone okay?
Can we really call this a victory?
This world is cruel...yet still so beautiful.
Mission failed! Withdraw!
That was it. There won't be another opportunity.
We've got the upper hand!
We can't stop them!
Time for battle!
Moving forward!
I'm going to help them!
I'll never abandon them!
I'll hold my ground!
I'm teaming up!
Advance! Hurry!
Go and support them!
Our friends need us. Come on, people!
Shore up our defense!
Mission complete. What's next?
Mission failed. But all is not lost.
We have to abort the mission.
I'm strong... I'll tear them all to pieces!
There's no point struggling on.
This world is cruel. But it's also beautiful.
I don't care who or what stands in my way-I will not allow Eren to die. 
My strength exists solely to protect Eren.
I have a place in this world that I call home.
Eren taught me how to live. I'll never give up on living.
