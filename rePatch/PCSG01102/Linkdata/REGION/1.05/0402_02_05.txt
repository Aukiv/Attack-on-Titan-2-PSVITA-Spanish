So far so good. Just stay alert.
There are still more. No time to rest.
That one was vicious! I'm winded.
That was a tough one. It's a miracle I'm still alive.
This one looks strong... Do we have to fight it?!
Huh?! An Abnormal!
A smoke signal. Are they in trouble?
Can we make it in time?! We've got to help them!
Sorry. Didn't mean to drag you into this.
Sorry for being a burden.
You came, [0:HERO_FAMN]. I'm still breathing thanks to you.
Sorry about that, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I guess I screwed up.
Thanks, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Saved me again. I'll pay off this tab one day.
It's only natural for us to help each other.
I'll try to keep it up.
Thanks, Reiner. We WILL get back home...one of these days.
Oh, uh... Thanks for the assist, Annie.
Whew! Close one. You're a star, Conny.
You're a born strategist, Armin. Thanks.
You're a lifesaver, Jean. Literally!
One day, Reiner. One day...for sure.
I, erm... I'm just glad I made it in time!
Aw, c'mon. We're friends, right?
Heheh. I'm not used to getting compliments.

So brave... I could learn a thing or two.
You're so graceful in battle.
You're breezing through this, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
Where'd you pick up THOSE skills, [0:HERO_FSTN]? I'm astounded.
Just amazing, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I'm proud to call you my friend.
Good work, Reiner! Now let's end this-together!
Intense, Armin... I sure am glad we're on the same side!
Looking awesome out there, Annie. You know I really...respect you. Yeah.
You're tearing it up, Daz! Hey, I'm scared too, but...it's all for the mission.
That's the commander for you-brilliant...and lethal.
Wow, how did you kill such a formidable Titan?!
Now that's the work of an experienced soldier.
You trounced that thing, [0:HERO_FAMN]! Surreal!
Were I equipped with your resolve, [0:HERO_FSTN]...maybe I could've been stronger.
I can hardly believe my eyes, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You're worlds ahead of me.
Urgh... Somebody, help!
Please, we need reinforcements!
I'm on my way! Just hold on!
I'm coming for you!
Someone... Please hurry!
Reinforcements! I can't hold on any longer!
I'll help you. Just hang on a little longer!
Not good. They need help-stat!
Are you okay? Let's stick together from now on.
How's the situation?
I'm all right. Let's do this.
I'm fine. Let's go!
I've reached my limit!
That's enough. I'm out of here.
Sorry to keep you waiting!
It looks like you're not finished here. I'll lend a hand!
Okay, let the battle commence!
Sometimes you just need to take it easy.
It's too soon to lose hope. We will return home alive.
We will save them!
We mustn't let them get away! Hurry!
Don't let them past. If they break through, it'll be a catastrophe.
Run for your lives! If they catch us, we're dead meat!
Let's finish this once and for all!
We're strapped for time! Stay light on your feet!
I'll do my best.
I can do this!
Yes, we won!
We stopped the Titans' advance!
That was a close one, but we made it.
So...I guess we won.
Yeah, we did it! Maybe now I can go home.
It looks like we've failed. We'd better retreat.
Is this the end for me?
We have the advantage. Maybe now we can win this.
They have the high ground. Things could get ugly...
Let's get this mission started.
Advancing!
I'm going to support them!
I'm going to save them!
I'll defend this place to my dying breath!
I'm teaming up!
Everyone, to the fore!
Our friends need assistance! Go!
Come on! Let's get our men out of there!
Defensive positions, people!
Great, mission complete!
Urgh... Mission failed.
There's no use... Aborting mission.
I won't let my comrades die!
It's impossible... We can't win.
I am...far from free. I envy everyone to be honest.
I will return to my homeland.
Somebody has to do this...
I just want to end all this as soon as possible.
Perhaps one day I will find something that's more important than my own life.
