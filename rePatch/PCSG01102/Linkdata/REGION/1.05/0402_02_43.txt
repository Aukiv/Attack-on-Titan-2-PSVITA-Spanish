Humanity isn't gonna cower before a bunch of Titans!

I managed to defeat it... Though it was a tough fight.

It's a powerful one. Everyone, get ready..
Is that an Abnormal? Stay alert!
Distress call sighted. I'm making my way to them.
That smoke signal! There's no time to lose!
Thanks.
Thank you.



That's not like you. Pull yourself together.
I'm just glad you're all right.










Nice job.
That is how it should be done.








An excellent performance against such a powerful Titan. You're a true soldier.
It must be your wealth of experience that gives you such an edge.



Uh-oh... Can someone lend me a hand?
I hate to ask, but I need help.
I'm coming. Just hold on.
I hear you. I'm on my way.
I fear this may be lights out for me.
I didn't fulfill my duty... I'm sorry.
Don't give up! I'll help you, no matter what!
Keep it together!
You all right?
Are you all right?
I'm fine, thanks.
I'm all right. Let's go.
What an undignified end.
Now would be a good time for me to leave. Falling back!
Sorry I'm late.

We've got what it takes to win this.
I'll move erratically and confuse the enemy. Hopefully that tactic works on Titans.
How are we supposed to get out of this predicament?
We have to rescue our comrades by any means necessary.
We mustn't let them escape. Stay on them!
We will defend this area.
Don't let the enemy catch up with you. Just try to stay calm.
This is do or die.
There's no time. Get a move on.
Understood.
Understood. Let's go.
Victory is ours.
It looks like we held our ground.
Did everyone get away?
If you look at the big picture, we were victorious. That's enough for now.
We did it! Humankind has finally defeated the Titans!
We failed our mission. There's nothing else we can do.
Such a...meaningless death...
We're dominating the battlefield. Excellent.
They're closing in... We have to do something.
Let's get the mission started.
Charging them head-on!
I'm going to support our comrades! Okay?!
They need help right now!
Defending this area is our priority.
I'd better join forces.
Advance! Onward!
Support our comrades! Hurry!
Our comrades are in danger! Save them!
You must not allow that area to fall into enemy hands!
Mission accomplished... It went exactly as I thought.
We failed. Was our planning at fault?
It's important to know when to run... This mission is aborted.
For the victory of humankind!
Have all our efforts been for nothing?
