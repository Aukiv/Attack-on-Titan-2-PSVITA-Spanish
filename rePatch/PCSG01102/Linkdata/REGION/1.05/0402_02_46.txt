Huh...? I beat another one!

Wow, I actually beat that thing... I'm not so bad after all...

Wh-what kinda Titan is that?
It's an Abnormal... I dunno what to do.
A distress call... I'm scared, but we can't just leave them.
No! We can't let them die!
Th-thank you. I'm so relieved.
Th-th-thank you!



Erm... I glad you're okay.
It was nothing! I'm just happy to be of use.










Wow... Awesome.
Yo-you're amazing.








Huh? What? Did you kill it?
With enemies that strong, maybe it'd just be better if I stayed at home.



No! Someone, help!
Someone! Please, help!
Huh?! I-I have to go.
Okay! I'm coming!
I can't move... I don't wanna move.
Please, don't leave me.
No, you have to stay alive.
I-I'll call for help.
Whoa?! A-are you okay?
Hey?! A-are you okay?
Ergh?!! Ye-yeah, I'm fine.
Huh?! Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm getting outta here! I'm dead if I stay any longer!
This is as good a time as any. Falling back!
Sorry you've only got me to back you up!

Here we go! Please look out for me!
Can I just hide so the Titans don't see me?
There's no way we're getting out of this alive.
I-I'm scared...but we have to save our comrades.
Can't we just let them run away?
Defend? Does that mean I can't run away?
Run! As fast as you can!
I just don't want to live in fear anymore!
There's no time! Hurry!
Yeah, I'm coming!
Yes, I'm on my way!
Have we...won?
We did it...and I'm still alive.
Phew...we got away.
What a waste of life.
Is it over? Are we free now?
We failed... Did I get in the way?
That's it... I'm done... So tired.
Our comrades have got them pinned down? Great.
Huh?! Our comrades are pinned down?
Is it okay to start the mission?
Looks like we have to charge them head-on... I don't feel to good.
I'll support our comrades.
Our comrades are in danger! I have to help them.
I'm scared...but I'll hold my ground.
I hate being by myself. I'm joining forces.
Advance...please.
Please, support our comrades.
Someone go and save our comrades.
Make sure you hold that ground!
We completed the mission. I'm so glad it's over.
Failed the mission? Was it my fault?
It doesn't look like we can carry on with the mission.
I don't wanna die, so I have to fight!
I can't do this anymore! I don't have any fight left in me!
