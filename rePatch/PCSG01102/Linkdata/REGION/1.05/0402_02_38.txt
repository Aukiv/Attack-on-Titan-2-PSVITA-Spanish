No matter what happens, I will always carry out my orders...





What's that?! Are there Titans?
That smoke... What does it mean?!
Th-thank you.

It was by God's will that you rescued me...














Hmm... Well done.

Well done... The Lord must be happy as well...


No matter how many Titans you defeat, you're still a treacherous roach...




Unbelievable... How could a human possess such strength?

You beat that Titan...? Unbelievable...


















We must protect the church and the patrons.










It seems we've won...but...








This is the will of the Lord... Never forget that, everyone!





Our Lord speaks! He commands you to advance!
They need your support. Become the hand of our Lord.
We must not forsake those who believe in the Lord! Go to their rescue!
It is our Lord who protects. We are merely His helpers.
Our Lord is the architect of this victory. Give Him your devotion!
Behold, we have failed in our mission! Because you doubted our Lord!
We don't have enough faith, that's why this mission must be aborted...


That Wall is the work of God, beyond human understanding.
No matter what happens, I will always carry out my orders...
