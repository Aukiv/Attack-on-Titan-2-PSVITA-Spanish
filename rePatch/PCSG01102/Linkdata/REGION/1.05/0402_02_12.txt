You're in my way. Move.
Filthy creatures...
Could you have died any slower? Geez.
Even with that one dead, our situation hasn't improved much.
That Titan is out of the recruits' league. I guess I'll deal with it.
An Abnormal!
It's a distress call. We can't ignore it.
We need to move. And fast.
Thanks for the help.
Thank you for taking the trouble.
That you, [0:HERO_FAMN]? Thanks.
You saved me, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I owe you.
It seems your decision saved me, [0:HERO_FSTN].
If you can still fight, get back on the mission.
Just don't go wasting any more of my time.
Thanks, Erwin. Fighting's supposed to be my strong suit...
I see you're coming along nicely, Eren.
Now this is unexpected.
Thanks for that. You have my full trust.
Military Police brass? With a heart? I'm touched.
I can't lose you here. It would be a disservice to the fallen.
The best thing you can do right now is calm down. You're flailing like an Abnormal.
Don't blame yourself. Right now we need to focus on surviving.
I'm not totally ignorant. For one, I know mankind needs you alive.
Don't mention it, Eren. This is what we do, after all.
Nice, that's what I like to see.
That's the spirit.
You're full of surprises, [0:HERO_FAMN].
Good, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Good.
Not bad, [0:HERO_FSTN]. It seems I no longer need to treat you like a recruit.
The years haven't dulled your skills in the slightest, Erwin.
The best part about you-is your determination to dismember these overgrown flesh bags.
Finally decided to be a real soldier, Eren?
You've got skills. Still green, but deadly enough in a fight.
I figured you could do as much. Keep it up, will you?
Just the outcome I was hoping for.
You killed it. That's less work for me to do.
Well done, [0:HERO_FAMN].
You beat him, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I knew you had potential.
I see you're in high spirits, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Well, fight your heart out. I won't stop you.
Crap, they've got me pinned down.
Hello? Backup! It's getting dire over here!
Hang on! I'll be right there!
Got it! I'm coming!
Hey, someone help out over here!
Hey, someone get over here right now!
Relax! Don't get yourself killed before I get there!
Damn. Hope I make it...!
You're still alive and kicking.
You're still alive? What's the situation?
There's no time for chit-chat. Move out.
You know what to do. Let's move.
We've done what we can. It's either pull out now or become Titan slop.
I'm done here. I'm gonna fall back.
You could probably do with my help.
This looks like hell on earth.
Here goes.
I'm gonna get this place spick and span.
What a snafu... I'll just have to make the most of it.
Our objective is to rescue our comrades. Don't screw it up.
Don't let 'em get away. Put 'em down for good.
Hold the bastards here. Got it?
Move! Run for your lives!
I don't know what's right, but this is the choice we made.
Time is of the essence. Get a move on.
I'm right here with you. Let's not mess this one up, people.
Understood.
Victory is ours. Good job, soldiers.
It looks like our defense held. Great work.
We got away. Take a break; you've earned it.
Not a clean victory-but at least it's over.
This isn't the end. Our true fight is about to begin.
We can't fulfill this mission anymore. Head back.
Sometimes believing in yourself just isn't enough.
Don't ease up! Crush the freaks!
Damn, they're pinning us down.
Hey, it's time to kick off this mission.
Let's advance.
Let's provide support.
We have to help them!
Don't let them get any further than here!
I'll team up.
Advance!
You lot, go and support them!
Go and save your comrades!
Protect the area!
Looks like we did it.
Damn, we failed.
We can't carry on any longer.
Do you all wanna die so badly?!
What a mess. Our losses are too great.
Make it back alive first. Only then are you a REAL Scout.
Narrowing down the "right" choice is impossible on the battlefield. That's why I choose the one I'll regret the least. 
You're looking at the man who's gonna make those Titan bastards extinct.
I hate the idea of an empty death, be it mine or someone else's.
Hell waits outside those walls. But at least there's freedom. And that's what keeps me going back, mission after mission.
