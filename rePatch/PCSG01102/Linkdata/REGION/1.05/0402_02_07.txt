Who's the MAN?!
See just how strong I am!
This job's never easy!
Timber! You never stood a chance against me!
That's not your run-of-the-mill Titan!
It looks like an Abnormal!
That smoke signal... They need help!
We've gotta help them! Hurry!
Thanks for the help!
Thank you!
Appreciate the assist, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
Nice to see you, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Now THAT'S timing!
Thanks, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I know you got my back!
Anytime!
It was nothing!
Who woulda thought the boy with a death wish would save MY ass?
H-hey Mikasa. Thanks for the helping hand.
Thanks for the assist, Marco! I'll come running the next time you're in a fix!
Reiner, am I glad to see you! Thanks.
You saved my skin, ma'am. I appreciate it!
Gratitude's the LAST thing I was expecting outta you. Anyway-don't die.
That was a close one! Be careful out there, Mikasa.
Be careful, would you? Or if you're gonna die-make it awesome, at least!
I'll be waiting with high hopes then!
Tone it down a little, Thomas! You only get one life, you know?
Wow, impressive!
Wow, I guess experience makes all the difference.
Badass, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
You're wrecking them, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Save some for me!
You keep getting stronger, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Respect!
There goes Mr. Death Wish. I can't let him enjoy all the attention!
Top-notch work, Mikasa. My jaw dropped.
You're a cut above the rest, Marco!
Dependable as always, Reiner! Glad you're with us.
You always pull through, Armin!
You killed it... Awesome.
You're in a league of your own! How can I get to be like that?
Holy... [0:HERO_FAMN], you gotta show me how to do that!
Damn fine work, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Give me some pointers later?
What ARE you, [0:HERO_FSTN]? Most people'd be messing their pants!
Sorry to ask, but can you lend a hand?!
I need support here!
Hold on! I'm coming to help!
I'm on my way! Just hang on a little longer!
Guys? I'm a few seconds away from death here!
Help, please! I'm in hot water!
Damn! I need to get a move on or they're dead meat!
I have to hurry! There's no time to lose!
Hey, are you all right?!
Are you okay?!
Glad to see you're still in one piece.
Hehe, it all worked out.
I got sloppy.
That's enough for today. I'm done for now.
Titan scum, now you've got me to contend with!
It looks like you could do with my help!
Cut 'em all to ribbons!
I'm not gonna be outdone by some suicidal bastard!
I can't die in a place like this!
I hope we can get to them in time!
I'll run 'em down and tear 'em to pieces!
Don't let a single one pass!
Huh? So now we need to run away if we wanna win?
This is what I signed up for!
We haven't got time to stand around thinking!
Let's do it!
Jean Kirschtein, ready for action!
Next time, I'll pull out all the stops!
We did it. What a relief!
It looks like we managed to get away.
Is it over? Did we win?
We did it... I'm just glad it's all over!
Come on! I can't believe we failed!
When will I learn?!
We've almost finished them off!
We've had it!
Okay, let's get started!
Advancing!
They need my support!
I've gotta help!
Nothing's gonna get through me!
I'd better team up!
C'mon, people! Give 'em hell!
Reinforcements!
I've gotta help. Lend me a hand!
Defend with everything you've got!
Mission complete! Yeah!
We royally botched this mission!
It's best that we abort this mission.
Time for me to step up!
I guess it's time to face up to reality.
I know we have to fight. That's just how it is.
This is the job we chose-and we have to see it through.
Eren and me are...alike? That a joke? You certainly won't catch me laughing.
I gave my ODM a strong blast for just a second and relied on inertia to save gas.
I'm honest to a fault, but it's better than being one of those guys who acts tough but is actually terrified.
