Bring on my next beautiful specimen!
I'm glad I'm getting to encounter lots of Titans, but there aren't any interesting ones.
Ah ha ha! Almost had me there, gorgeous!
It was a fascinating specimen, but unfortunately I had to kill it.
That Titan looks very interesting!
Yeah, an Abnormal!
Maybe there are some strong Titans over there?
It looks like the Titans have got them pinned down!
Thanks for the help!
I appreciate your help!
Appreciate the assist, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
Thanks, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Let's give 'em hell and go home!
Hey, [0:HERO_FSTN]! With you around, we're practically unstoppable!
There's no way I could ever abandon a comrade.
Your death would throw the Corps into chaos.
Sorry, Levi. I screwed up bad...
Thanks, Moblit! I knew I could count on you!
Erwin-thank you. And sorry for the trouble.
Having you around makes all the difference, Miche. I mean it!
Thanks! The Levi Squad has a practical bevy of all-stars!
Aw, don't mention it. Besides, I can't have you saving ME all the time, can I?
Exactly! I was worried about you-and certainly NOT drawn to this beautiful Titan or anything. Yep!
Glad to be of service. But play it safe, okay?
If you must know, ALL Titans fascinate me! ...But I think survival takes priority over research right now.
Let's just say a lot's happened. And people don't grow up by choice.
How brave!
Amazing! I need to push myself harder.
I like your style, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
What a display, [0:HERO_FSTN]! With you around, I'll be able to blow through loads of research.
Wow, [0:HERO_FSTN]-I had to pick up my own jaw there! Can't wait to see more.
I see why they call you the Scout Regiment's rising star. Those moves are wicked!
Your skills are as sharp as ever. Just stay alive so you can use them, okay?
I saw that one, Moblit! Attaboy!
The Levi Squad sure knows how to clean house!
Sir, I'm astounded! Leaving the front lines hasn't affected your battle skills at all!
What? You've killed it already? That was a rare Titan. I wanted to observe it.
Fighting like that, you've still got what it takes to serve on the front line.
You beat THAT? Good going, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
Thanks to your field skills, my menagerie will be getting quite a few new additions!
You keep getting better and better, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Amazing!
Guys, a helping hand, please?
Sorry, but please lend a hand!
I'll be right there!
I'm coming! Just hang on a little longer!
Oh no... Come quickly!
Getting pummeled out here! Assistance, please!
Hang in there! Please let me make it in time!
I have to hurry!
Are you okay?
How are things here?
It looks like you're fine!
I'm okay. I'll stick with you.
I don't think I can fight anymore.
I've played my part. Falling back.
I made it. Where are the Titans?
Sorry I'm late.
Wait for me, my beauties! Mama's coming!
I can't see any interesting specimens, but I'll go and find some!
It doesn't look like I have any time to play with the Titans.
They desperately need our help.
Look, they're on the run!
They're not getting past me.
Run for your lives!
We need to win this fight at any cost.
Sorry, Titans. No time to play with you today.
Right, let's go and meet some new Titans.
I'll be right there with you!
I can't see any more. Looks like we got all of them!
Looks like we fought them off!
So long, Titans!
Do you think perhaps they let us win?
So it's finished.
That's it. We've failed the mission.
If I die now, I won't be able to study the Titans anymore.
We're all over them! Victory will soon be ours!
They're all over us! We're going to lose!
If we complete this mission... Hehehe.
Advancing now!
We need to support them!
We have to help them quickly!
I'll defend this place with my life!
I should team up!
Okay, advance!
Give them support!
Go and help them!
Tighten up our defenses!
Woohoo! Mission complete!
We've failed the mission.
We have no choice but to abort the mission!
I simply must get even closer to the Titans!
Too many of us have been eaten by the Titans.
Man, I'm pumped! I feel like I did when I first saw Levi in action!
If you don't know something, learn it! Simple as that.
Each Titan has a unique personality. Just because they're all big doesn't mean they're the same.
I want to try looking at the Titans from a different point of view. It might prove to be futile, but still, I'll do it.
For me, interacting with the Titans is so enlightening that it makes me completely forget my everyday fatigue.
