Buh-bye, meatbag!
You Titans may be big, but that's all you've got going for you!
Did you guys see that? I must be invincible!
I should be proud of myself for killing that one!
I'm getting a bad feeling about this one!
Looks like an Abnormal!
Check out that smoke signal. Something's not right!
See that smoke signal? We've got a critical situation!
Thanks for the help!
Thank you!
[0:HERO_FAMN], you came! Thanks!
You're always looking out for me, [0:HERO_FSTN]!
Saved my hide again, [0:HERO_FSTN]-just like I knew you would!
Don't worry about it!
Hehe, not bad, eh?
Thanks, Reiner! With you here, we've practically won this thing!
Heya, Marco! Am I glad we're friends!
Thanks heaps, Jean. I'll return the favor sometime!
Saved by the potato girl...? I'm grateful, but you're not getting my rations!
Uh oh. That was Freckles who saved me. Knowing her, she'll want something later...
I know my way around the battlefield!
Geez, could you be more reckless? Anyway-glad I made it in time.
You owe me one, Ymir! Got that?
Uh. You're very welcome? ...Sir!
Well, sir? I'm not half bad, eh?
Impressive!
Wow... I wonder if I can do that.
You're pretty good, [0:HERO_FAMN]! Not as good as me though, obviously.
Nice one, [0:HERO_FSTN]! I'd say you're on par with me now.
Geez, [0:HERO_FSTN]! You're more of a beast than the Titans!
Good going, Sasha! I'd better up my game too!
I like your style, Christa! Keep sticking it to 'em!
Glad you're with us, Reiner! You never disappoint!
Phenomenal, Jean! Now let's see who can topple more Titans!
How do you stay so calm when fighting these things, Annie?
Wow, you actually killed it!
It may have been tough, but it was no match for you.
You beat that thing, [0:HERO_FAMN]?! ...Outta this world.
You schooled that overgrown freak, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Good going!
Niiiice, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Just another day for you, I'm sure.
Hey, a little help over here!
Give me a hand!
Got it! I'm coming!
Sure, I'm on my way!
I'm done for... Help!
No... Please help!
I'm coming! Don't die on me!
I've gotta help before it's too late!
Hey, you still in one piece?
Are you okay?!
Looks like we're both fine!
It looks like everything worked out.
I'm gonna have to withdraw.
I think I've fought enough for today.
I'm here to do some fighting!
Looks like I'm just in time!
Keep an eye on me; you could learn a thing or two!
The early bird catches the worm!
There's no way I'm dying here!
We've gotta help them!
You ain't getting away from me!
Ain't nothing gonna get past me!
They're not gonna catch me!
It's all come down to this!
Time is a luxury we don't have.
I'll show you just what I can do!
I'm right here with you!
Yeah, we did it!
We held out! Great job!
Glad we made it outta that one!
Did we really win?
It's all over! Does that mean I can go home now?
Dammit, we failed.
Is this how it all ends for me?
Nice! Don't let up!
Dammit. We're losing ground!
I can't afford to screw up this mission!
Is it okay to advance?
Our people need help!
We've gotta help them!
There's no way anything's getting past me!
Teaming up!
Okay, let's go!
Give them some support!
Go and help them!
Don't let anything get through!
Looks like we succeeded!
Damn... We failed.
It might be time to throw in the towel.
Let me at 'em!
The Titans are owning us.
Putting your life on the line for someone without a second thought-now that's heroic.
Wonder what Mom'd say if she saw me now?
I'm a pro on the battlefield. I'll make it out of any mission they throw at us!
Now that I've graduated in the top ten, I'll be able to hold my head up high when I go back to my village!
Everyone back home said a runt like me'd never become a soldier.
