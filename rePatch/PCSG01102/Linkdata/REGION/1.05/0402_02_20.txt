Don't let up! It's not over yet!
That's what they can expect if they try to attack us!
Ha! Dead! And not a moment too soon!
That was a strong one. But we were stronger!
I'm not gonna let you have your way!
An Abnormal! We have to stop it!
It's a distress call! We have to help!
That smoke signal...! They haven't got long!
Thanks for the help.
I appreciate your help!
Thanks! Oh, [0:HERO_FAMN]? What a pleasant surprise.
Saved me again, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I'll repay the favor next time around.
I knew you'd come running for me, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Now, let's finish this together!
The fight isn't over, yet! Focus!
I'm glad you're okay. Be careful!
Thanks, Captain! Won't happen again!
Thanks for the help. Now let's show these goons what real teamwork is!
Thanks, Eren. I guess even superior officers need saving sometimes.
My utmost thanks, Commander. They caught me off guard.
Thanks, Oruo. I guess your Titan-slaying skills make up for, you know...the rest of you.
I'd stake my life time and again for you, sir!
You said it, Gunther! We'll cut them down together!
Don't mention it, Eld! What are friends for?
Humble as always, Oruo...

Very impressive...but I won't let you outshine me!
You're so fast! I have to keep up!
You've got skills, [0:HERO_FAMN]. But you still need to learn trust.
Looking good, [0:HERO_FSTN]! I see a bright future ahead of you.
How about applying to Special Ops, [0:HERO_FSTN]? We could use you!
The captain's unmatched on the battlefield. I'd fight for him to my last breath!
Check out that flawless maneuvering. Man, I have some practicing to do...
Since when could you do that, Eren?
You're dominating this battle, Commander! Amazing!
The quickest way to the captain's trust is competence, Oruo.
You killed that Titan?! Wow!
I'm surprised you took that thing down.
I'm speechless, [0:HERO_FAMN]. No recruit I know could do THAT.
Amazing, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Even my squad would have trouble putting that thing down.
Are you serious, [0:HERO_FSTN]? You might as well be a seasoned vet!
Good timing. Lend a hand!
I hate to ask, but I need a little help!
I've got you! Brace yourself!
I'll be right there!
It wasn't supposed to turn out like this...!
I can't do this alone. Reinforcements!
I'm coming! Don't die on me!
I'll be right there! Hold on!
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?!
I'm fine. Let's go.
Thanks for your concern. I'm good to go!
I'm in over my head. Retreating!
I'm leaving the front line!
Whew. Our friends are still alive!
Petra Ral, here to back you up!
We can do this! Move out!
Let's show them what the Scout Regiment's Special Operations Squad can do!
No, I don't wanna die! We're gonna get through this!
Saving our comrades is our highest priority! Hurry!
We're coming for you! You won't get away that easily!
I'm gonna defend this area, whatever comes my way!
Just focus on getting away! Don't try to take them on!
This is what it's all been leading up to. Give it everything you've got!
We're almost out of time! Let's end this-fast!
Believe in yourselves.
I'll do my duty!
We won! We can do anything when we work together!
Yeah, we held out!
I'm just glad we got away in one piece.
Next time we face them, we will win a decisive victory!
This is the power of the teamwork of humanity!
Does that smoke signal mean we can't continue the mission?! It's over.
I can't...go on.
We've got the wind in our sails.
Not good. We'll lose at this rate.
This mission should be a walk in the park.
Heading for our objective!
Leave the support to me!
I won't let them die in vain!
I won't give them a single inch!
I need to team up.
Full speed ahead! Stay alert!
Support our comrades!
Go and help them!
Hold your ground! Repel the bastards!
Yeah, what a result!
We...failed? I don't believe it.
It's best we pull out. Abandoning mission.
I'll stop them dead in their tracks!
Do we humans have any hope of stopping them?
Going it solo only gets you so far. That's why we work together.
Making the right choice is tough to pull off.
Dad's probably worried sick...
I fight for Lieutenant Levi. I'm prepared to sacrifice everything for him.
It's because we're weak that we need to come together.
