I smell a promotion around the corner...
That was dangerous. If I was like the other slackers in the Military Police, I'd probably be long dead.
I did it! I took it down! Guess all that training paid off.
A promotion can't be far off now that I've killed such a dangerous Titan.
That looks like one dangerous Titan!
It's an Abnormal! Be careful!
That smoke signal... They're in trouble! Move it!
They're in danger! Come on, hurry!
Thanks for the help.
Thank you for your assistance!
Thanks, [0:HERO_FAMN]. I'm lucky to have such a capable friend.
You're an idealist like myself. Is that why you came for me, [0:HERO_FSTN]?
You're a true hero, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Together, I'm sure we can right the corruption in this world.
As a soldier, it's the least I can do.
We can't afford to lose an officer like you.
I wasn't expecting you personally, Commander. It's an honor!
Do me one more favor, Hitch? Let's just tell everyone I made the assist-you made the kill.
I always thought you were kind of cold, but I guess you do care, Annie!
P-Premier?! I mean, ahem-it's an honor, sir! Thank you for your assistance.
You risked your life for a recruit from another regiment? ...I can't thank you enough.
The name's Marlo Freudenberg, sir! Do you remember me?
Darn straight. I'll be leading the Military Police one day!
Forgot how to say thanks, Annie?
Should anything happen to you, sir, our ranks would be thrown into chaos.

Very well done. Looks like I have some catching up to do.
Amazing, just how an officer should be.
Nice offense, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
You inspire me, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Time to hone my own skills and move up the ranks!
Let's right this corrupt world, [0:HERO_FSTN]-together!
He's dominating the battle like a front line regiment. The title of "commander" isn't just for show...
You're obviously capable, Hitch. So why don't you try more often?
I always knew there was something different about you, Annie. Perhaps this is it.
Soldiers from the southern Cadet Corps are tough as nails! Hard to believe we're both in the 104th...
Incredible. I see why he stands at the top of all the regiments.
You killed it? Astonishing.
You killed it. I guess you need that strength to rise through the ranks.
I thought you were running to your death, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Seems I was wrong.
You kept your cool with that thing, [0:HERO_FSTN]? Now that's guts.
Let's work together, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I see long lives and promotions in store.
I'm in trouble! Requesting assistance!
Give me a hand!
Got it. I'm coming!
I'll be right there!
I'm done for! Please help me!
Please, help me!
Hang on a little longer! I'm coming!
I'm coming to help! Please let me make it in time!
Are you okay?
What's your situation?
I'm fine. Let's go.
I'm okay. Let me join you.
Darn. I'm out of this fight.
I did my part. Time to leave.
Marlo Freudenberg, reporting for duty!
Great, looks like I made it in time!
I'll see this mission done to perfection.
If I get the top spot, I'm a shoo-in for a promotion!
I promised myself I'd get to the top of the Military Police Regiment. There's no way I'm going to die here.
I'll save our comrades!
I'll chase them down!
I'll hold my ground!
The situation is not good. We have to get out of here.
It's do or die!
Get this mission done as fast as you can!
Yes, I'll see it done to perfection!
Marlo Freudenberg, ready for battle!
We won. I'm sure my contribution won't go unnoticed!
We stood our ground. Mission complete.
We got away. Withdrawal successful.
What? Have we won?
This is a victory for humanity... No, for me!
The mission is a lost cause. We have to withdraw.
I can't afford to die before I reach the top.
Everything's going in our favor.
We're losing ground...!
Let's get the mission underway!
Joining the advance!
I have to support our comrades!
I'll help!
I must hold this area!
Going to team up!
Onward, advance!
Provide support!
Save them!
Shore up our defenses!
We saw this mission done to perfection!
Damn. This mission's a failure.
We have no choice but to abort the mission!
I'll prove my worth and rise to the top!
Ugh. I bit off more than I can chew with this one...
I'll do anything to right the wrongs of this world.
People tend to point out my hair. I mean, is it that weird?
Each soldier must be prepared to sacrifice. We do not function together otherwise.
The Scout Regiment risks its life for humankind. It deserves respect.
When I'm at the top, I'll make all the slackers in the Military Police earn their pay.
