All right! At this rate, we're practically home-free!
I'm glad my effort paid off, but maybe I was a little reckless.
H-hey! I got one! I actually got one!
That was a big one. That'll surely net me some praise later.
That Titan... It's horrifying!
That looks like an Abnormal.
That color... We have to help!
Smoke signal sighted! Please let us make it in time!
Thanks for the help.
Thank you for your assistance.
Sorry for the trouble, [0:HERO_FAMN]. I owe you.
Thanks, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I'm glad you came.
Didn't mean to drag you into this, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I'll stay sharp from here on out!
We are comrades, after all!
Glad I could be of use!
I knew you'd come for me, Ymir. Thanks.
You saved me, Sasha! I'm grateful.
Thanks, Reiner. Sorry to drag you into this.
I thought I was finished! Thanks, Conny.
Mikasa?! You saved me. Thanks for that.
Stop joking around, Ymir. I was really worried about you!
What was that, Reiner? Sorry, I couldn't hear!
I'm just a regular girl, actually. And don't mention it. You're quite welcome.
I'm so glad I made it in time. Let's see this through together, Mina!
If you say so. I'm glad you're okay, though!
Amazing. Aren't you frightened?
Watching you reminds me just how much I still have to learn!
Incredible, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Aren't you the least bit scared?
You're a natural, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Unlike me...
Watching you is...oddly inspiring, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Now I have something to strive for!
You're strong, Ymir. Far stronger than me.
Good one, Sasha! Talk about lightning-quick!
You're a legend, Mikasa. I'd never be able to mimic that.
You're our rock, Reiner. Solid and strong.
Good work, Daz! I remember you were petrified earlier.
Wow! How did you defeat such a formidable Titan?
You killed it so quickly. I have no idea how you did it.
You took that thing...and won? I'm speechless, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
If only I had your strength, [0:HERO_FSTN]...
I knew you'd win, [0:HERO_FSTN]. It's time I started pulling my weight too!
Lend a hand, please!
I need backup!
Hold on. I'm coming!
I'm coming. Don't let go!
Someone, please help!
Things are bad. I need assistance!
I'm coming! Don't die on me!
I have to make it in time!
Are you all right?
Are you okay?
Phew, it looks like you're all right.
I'm glad you're okay!
I can't fight anymore. Retreating.
I think it's time to pull out.
I made it in time. Ready to fight!
Is everyone okay? I'm here to help!
Let's go! I'm not going to let any of you die!
I can contribute. I just need to try!
It may be dangerous, but I'm going to fight to the end!
We'll save you! Just hold on!
If we don't go after them now, they'll launch a counter attack!
I won't let them break through!
Run away! Don't any of you go getting yourselves killed!
Now is the time when we must give our all!
Hurry or we won't make it!
We will win this!
Christa Lenz, ready for battle!
We beat the Titans!
Yeah, we did it!
We got away by the skin of our teeth.
It could have been much worse.
I did well. Now they'll see...!
We failed the mission. We have to retreat.
I was no use to anyone.
We can win this! Keep going, guys!
They're all over us! Be careful!
If we complete this mission, maybe...
It looks like we have to advance!
I'm going to provide support!
We'll save you!
We must hold our ground!
We should rendezvous with the others.
Now, advance!
Back up our friends!
Go, save them!
Help me! We have to protect them!
Mission complete!
No... We failed.
We can't carry on the mission!
Friends fight together!
They're going to pick us off one by one.
I chose this path. I'll see it through.
I've always had a way with animals. I think that's why my horse-riding grades were so good.
I'm not the greatest soldier-but a soldier, nonetheless!
Even if I die, I'll be glad if people praise me for fighting my hardest.
It's an odd thing to say, chances being what they are, but I'd like for us to survive this ordeal together.
