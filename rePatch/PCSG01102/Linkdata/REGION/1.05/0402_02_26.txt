Taking on the Elite Squad has lethal consequences!
We really cleaned house.
Damn, almost died there! Hope there's no more of those...
It's down! Things should be a little easier from now on.
This won't be fun. Not one bit.
Is it...an Abnormal?!
A smoke signal! What's happening?
That smoke signal means trouble. Better hurry.
Thanks for the help.
Thank you.
Sheesh, saved by a kid... Aw, well-I owe you one!
Sorry to be a burden, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Hey-lunch is on me, okay?
Thanks, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You're always cleaning up my messes.
It's nothing. Get back to work.
This is a soldier's duty.
I guess I'm in no position to be calling you a kid anymore!
I heard there was a killer recruit loose in the field...and they were right. Remind me to stay on your good side!
Thanks! Looking out for each other-that's the real reason we're elites.
Thank you, Commander Pyxis! It won't happen again!
Saved by a scout, eh? Glad to be serving with you!
Please... If I gave the orders we'd all be dead!
Get it together, Rico! I know you can do better.
Thank you, sir. Your words do me too great an honor.
Please be careful, Captain. We might not always be close by.

Hmm, not bad.
That's totally out of my league.
Could use a little refinement, but good enough, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Now-let me show you how an elite operates!
I've never seen a recruit with such skill. You've got a bright future, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Blinding, even!
You continue to amaze, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I'm proud to call you a friend!
Niiice. You really are a walking weapon.
My compliments. I now see why Ian sortied you with his elites.
That's what I'm talking about! The elites will cut a path straight through these meat walls!
The commander has got to be training in his spare time...
Well done. Looks like the Garrison Regiment has elites of their own!
Nice job! Looks like I need to step things up.
You defeated that Titan?! Are you hurt?
Good to know you weren't just charging blindly ahead, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
What kind of training regimen do you have, [0:HERO_FSTN]? That was unreal!
You're a born Titan-killer, [0:HERO_FSTN]. None of those monsters are a match for you.
Hey, a little help here?!
Dammit all, I need assistance!
I can't just leave them!
I'm coming to help!
Damn, where are my reinforcements?
Requesting immediate assistance! I can't hold them off!
Hang on a little longer! Don't give up!
Got it! I'll be right there!
Are you still alive?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'll make it.
Hah, I can still fight!
Sorry... I need to fall back.
I've played my part. I'm outta here.
The Elite Squad will back you up!
Did I make it in time?! Reinforcements have arrived!
Are you ready? Let's get started!
I haven't got any fancy words. Let's get this party started!
Don't make this easy for them!
We have to save them! Whatever it takes!
Think you can outrun us, do ya?!
No one gets through-on our lives!
Run, soldiers! Run and don't you dare look back!
I dedicate this victory to our fallen comrades!
Move your asses! There's no time to hang around!
Okay, let's get started.
Yes, ready for action!
Yeah, mission complete!
It looks like we held our ground.
Withdrawal complete!
We can't call this a victory.
We did it! We've finally defeated the Titans!
Mission failed?! But we've come so far.
I'm...so sorry, guys...
Things are going pretty well...at least for now.
We're getting creamed. We need to regroup!
Time to kick off this operation!
I'm on the move.
I'm going to provide support.
Rescuing our troops is the top priority.
I'll hold them back.
Teaming up.
Now, advance!
Our comrades are in trouble! Help them!
Hurry up and save our comrades!
Hold back the Titans!
Yes, mission accomplished!
Mission failed. Dammit!
It's no use. I have to pull out.
Leave the rest to me!
We never stood a chance.
Who can we trust to ensure man's survival?
The first step to winning Commander Pyxis's trust...seems to be cultivating a palate for good drink. 
Unforeseen developments call for quick thinking on the fly.
I hate to see my comrades look so forlorn.
The Titans won't have their way on my watch.
