I can take down a Titan or two-you'll see!
Well? Not too shabby, eh?
I'm not letting the Titans win today!
Please don't move anymore!
Is...Is that a Titan?
An Abnormal! Be careful!
It's a distress call! We have to help!
A smoke signal! Please let us reach them in time!
You...saved me. Thanks.
Thank you so much!
I can't thank you enough, [0:HERO_FAMN].
You're my hero, [0:HERO_FSTN]. We should be able to turn things around now!
Thanks again, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Just seeing you gives me strength.
Let's just say you owe me one, heheh.
I'm just glad you're all right!
Thanks, Thomas! Now let's show the enemy what we're capable of.
Thanks for coming, Sasha. I'll pass you some grub later. Bread or potatoes-your choice!
Annie, you came for me! Thanks! I'm touched.
Phew! Thanks for bailing me out, Marco!
Thanks, Christa. I think I'll be okay now.
I'll be sure to hold you to it!
Just glad to see you alive, Christa.
Oh, Daz. I'd never leave you for dead! But do try to be careful.
S-Sir, yes, sir! I was born in a pigsty, sir! I am livestock! No, lower-SIR!

Wow! How can I learn how to do that?
So that's what you need to do to become a full-fledged member?
You're not taking prisoners today, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
Nice one, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Seems all I do is eat your dust these days.
Fabulous work, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Keep it up and you'll make it big!
You're pretty good at this soldier business, Sasha. Well, except when food's in the equation...
Great work, Eren! You're our shining star!
Amazing, Thomas! I'll soon be needing a plan to stay out of your shadow, heh!
Wow, Mikasa. Is your strength...human?
Your powers of observation are second to none, Marco. I'd better take notes!
Unbelievable! You killed it!
I hope I'll be able to defeat such strong Titans one day.
That's no small feat, [0:HERO_FAMN].
You did it! With you around, mankind stands more than a chance!
You never cease to amaze, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You had me gawking there!
Ouch! Please, help me!
Please, I need reinforcements!
Are you okay?! I'll be right there!
Got it! I'm coming!
I feel...faint.
I think...this is the end for me...
No! I have to help!
Hold on! I'll be right there!
Hey-you okay?!
Are you all right?!
I'm glad you're okay.
I'm okay. I'm good to carry on!
Unable to proceed. Pulling out!
I've done what I can. Leaving battlefield...
I've come to help!
Backup's here! Everyone okay?
Ready for combat.
The winner gets to eat the most meat, yeah?!
Do we even stand a chance?
Hang on! We'll save you!
You're not getting away! I'm gonna chase you down and destroy you!
I'll defend this area, no matter what comes my way!
Fighting back would be futile. Retreat.
We're ready for this!
There's no time! Hurry!
Okay, let's go!
I can do this!
We won...and I helped.
I held the area.
It's a miracle we escaped alive.
We won...but at too much of a cost.
We won! We beat the Titans!
Did we fail the mission?
I'm still...lower than livestock.
This is great! Victory is ours for the taking!
Aren't they overwhelming us? Aren't we in serious danger?
It's time for me to earn my keep!
I'm not scared. Advancing!
I'm going to support our comrades.
I'll help our comrades! I can't just ignore them!
I'll stand my ground until my last breath! Leave it to me!
Meeting up with the others is the smart move.
Now! Advance!
Support our comrades!
Our comrades are in danger! Help them!
I'm relying on you to defend the area!
Yeah! Mission complete!
We failed? No way.
Continuing this mission would be impossible. Abort!
I'm gonna make it into the Scout Regiment!
I...I can't do it. And while we're being honest, I'm really sc-sc...
Eren's speech the night of graduation moved me. It made me realize I had a role in this struggle.
Sasha's quite the character, always thinking about food!
Eren and Jean despise each other. You think Mikasa has something to do with it?
The instructor said I was livestock from a pigsty, but now I'm a full-fledged soldier.
I wonder what the real deal is between Eren and Mikasa.
