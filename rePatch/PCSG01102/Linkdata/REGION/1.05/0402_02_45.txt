Yes... This is gonna boost my kill count.

I took it down...! Glad I didn't give up...

This one's going to be tricky.
An Abnormal! Everyone, be careful!
A distress call?! Over there!
No, you can't let yourselves die!
Thanks for the help.
Thank you so much.



We have to help each other!
It was nothing!










Excellent.
A masterful performance.








No way. Did you really kill that thing?
Did I just see what I think I saw?



Ouch... Sorry, I need some help.
Sorry, could you lend a hand?
Are you okay? I'm coming!
I hear you. I'm on my way!
I'm done for... How can I get out of this?
It looks like...this is it for me.
No! I have to help!
What...?! I'll be there as soon as I can!
Hey-you okay?!
Are you hurt?
I'm okay. How about you?
No problem. I'm on my way.
I'm dead meat if I don't get out of here!
That should be enough. Falling back.
Sorry I'm late! What's the situation?!

We are humankind's last hope! Let's go!
Let's see who can take the top spot.
I never give up...no matter what I'm faced with!
I'll save my comrades, even if it kills me!
You won't get away from us! We'll chase you down!
I'll hold this ground at all costs!
Fighting during a retreat... This isn't going to be easy.
If we win this battle, humankind has hope of a future!
There's no time! Hurry!
Got it! I'm in!
I'll be there with you!
Yeah, we won!
We held our ground...phew.
We somehow made it...
I don't want to think that my comrades ignored me.
We beat the Titan. This is a dream come true.
A full retreat?! Have we failed the mission?
No... I don't...want to die.
We've got them on their heels. Let's keep it up.
Are the enemy's forces increasing?
It's about time to start the mission.
Moving forward! I'll break through their line!
Going to support our comrades!
Our comrades are in danger! I'm going to save them!
I've got the defense of this area covered!
Joining forces.
Now's our opportunity. Advance!
Go and support our comrades.
Saving our comrades is the top priority! Move!
I need you to defend that area.
Yeah, mission complete!
Mission failed?! No...
I don't think there's any way to continue this mission.
I'm a soldier! I'll fight until the very end!
Human life... It's so fragile.
