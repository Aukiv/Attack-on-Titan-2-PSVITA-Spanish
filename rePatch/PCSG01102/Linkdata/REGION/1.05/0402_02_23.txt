I'm on fire today!
It's down! On to the next target!
Whew. The section commander won't be happy, but taking time to study THAT thing would've been the death of me.
Now that's what I call a rare specimen! ...What even was it?
What kind of Titan is that?! The Section Commander will explode if she sees it.
It's an Abnormal!
It's a distress call! I'm on my way!
That smoke signal...! They don't have much time!
Thank you. You saved my life.
That was a close shave. Thank you for your help.
Thanks, [0:HERO_FAMN]. It's not my intention to endanger new recruits.
Saved by you again, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I hope you're not resenting the extra work.
You're my hero, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I knew you'd come!
That's what comrades are for.
I'm just glad you're okay.
You sensed my peril and came running. Thank you.
It's an honor to receive an assist from the regiment commander. Thank you.
Thank you, sir! I bit off more than I could chew there.
I see why the Levi Squad boasts the most confirmed kills.

Please just don't get yourself killed out there!
Glad you're okay. I'll be getting back to my mission now!



You're on fire! I gotta keep up!
Wow! That's impressive!
You're one feisty recruit, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
Looking good, [0:HERO_FSTN]! I hope some of your talent rubs off on me.
I'd say you're tough enough by now to help with the section commander's experiments!
And here I was thinking you'd only come to observe the Titans! Sorry I ever doubted you!
Nice, Eren! I take it the section commander's experiments have toughened you up?
This strength is one of the reasons he can so naturally command a motley regiment of eccentrics.
I wouldn't expect less of the team humanity's strongest has selected.
Well done, sir! You always give a courageous display.
You killed that Titan? Unbelievable.
I though that Titan would be unbeatable! Now I've seen everything!
You pulled that off, [0:HERO_FAMN]? This season's recruits sure are something.
You smoked that beast, [0:HERO_FSTN]?! You're anything but your average soldier.
With those skills, [0:HERO_FSTN], maybe you could've pulled off bringing that thing in alive...
Can you lend a hand?!
Sorry but I need some help here!
I'm coming!
I'll be right there!
I might be out for the count soon...
Sorry... I've reached my limit!
I'm not losing any more comrades!
Copy that! I'm coming for you!
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm too ashamed to face the section commander.
I need to consider the next mission. I'm done for now.
Requesting a sit rep!
Better late than never!
Titans sighted! Let the battle commence!
I'm the only one who can stop the section commander from going out of control!
We still have a small glimmer of hope! Let's fight!
Let's get a move on! The lives of our comrades are at stake!
Don't let the Titans get away!
Don't let the Titans take this territory!
The Titans are closing in! Get out of here as fast as you can!
Victory for mankind is finally within reach!
There's no time to waste!
I'll be right there with you!
I'll see to it that we accomplish our mission!
Yeah! Victory is ours!
Our defense held! Victory is ours!
We got away! Withdrawal complete!
It's not the result we'd hoped for, but the mission is over.
We won, didn't we? We humans have beaten the Titans!
That's the smoke signal for a full retreat! Looks like we've failed the mission.
It's my fault. I'm sorry.
This is going in our favor! Don't let up!
Everyone's fatigued. This isn't looking good...
Beginning the mission!
Advancing!
Leave the support to me!
I have to save our comrades!
I won't let our territory fall into enemy hands!
Teaming up!
Advance!
Support our comrades!
Save our comrades!
Tighten up our defenses!
We did it! Mission complete!
I'm sorry to say we've failed the mission!
The operation is no longer viable! Abandoning mission!
I serve directly under Section Commander Hange Zoë! The Titans won't be besting me yet!
I'll never be like the section commander.
I drank too much last night. Way too much.
Take your eyes off the section commander for a second and she'll run amok.
Serving under someone with a wild streak makes you more prudent.
I bet the section commander would be pleased if I captured a Titan alive.
The Scout Regiment really is a quirky bunch.
