Target down. Bring on the next one!
This should make things a little easier for us.
Hopefully that's the last of these we'll be seeing.
Another enemy of mankind bites the dust!
We mustn't shy away from this opponent! Proceed with caution!
An Abnormal! Stay alert!
A smoke signal... We have to save them.
Our allies need help! We'd better respond-quick!
Thanks, you got me out of a scrape there.
Thank you very much for your kind assistance.
Thanks for your help, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Didn't expect to be saved by a recruit.
Glad you're here, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Add that one to my tab.
[0:HERO_FSTN], I knew it. I'm bailing YOU out next time-deal?
You can never be too careful. Keep your guard up!
We can't afford to lose you now. Be careful.
Won't happen again, Captain!
Appreciate it. Now, to the mission!
Thanks, Commander. We'll take care of the heavy lifting from here.
Didn't mean to get another squad tangled in this. I'll be fine now. Thanks.

Acting under you and for you, sir-that's our duty!
There's no shame in being saved, Oruo. You're no use dead, after all!
We can't lose you, Eld. So keep it together, would you?
Music to my ears, Petra! C'mon!

Nice job. I need to step up my game.
Amazing. If I train hard, that'll be me one day.
Geez, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Those aren't the moves of a fresh recruit!
There's amazing and then there's you, [0:HERO_FSTN]. We senior officers had better step it up.
Your strength is an integral part of the regiment now, [0:HERO_FSTN].
What do I have to do to get to your level, Captain...?
Good work! For the captain, team!
You're a full-fledged soldier, Eren. No, better!
When the captain's not around, you're definitely the most qualified to lead us, Eld.
Amazing. I guess that's what you get with a service record longer than the captain's.
How did you defeat such a strong Titan?!
You killed it?! I'm lost for words!
I'll give you an "A" for effort, recruit. But do us a favor and concentrate on surviving?
I could never have taken that thing down when I was your age, [0:HERO_FSTN].
Is that your work, [0:HERO_FSTN]? Sheesh. Maybe I should be taking orders from YOU!
Sorry, I need a hand.
It's too much! Reinforcements!
Got it. Leave it to me.
I'm coming! Hang on!
Urgh... And I'd come so far...
Help, please... I'd rather not die in vain.
I'll be right there! Just hang on!
I have to help. I'm not letting you die!
Are you okay?!
Phew, are you all right?
I'm fine. Let's go.
Yeah, I'm still breathing.
I can't fight anymore. Sorry, but I have to fall back.
It's time for me to retreat!
Gunther, here. I take it the Titans are that way?
Am I in time? Reinforcements are here!
Are you ready? Let's go!
They said we can do what we want, but don't get overexcited.
Whether or not we break this deadlock is all down to us.
We can still make it. We must save them!
Don't just chase after them blindly! We need to be smart about this.
Keep your defenses tight! Don't let the Titans get their way!
Retreat! Run as fast as your legs will carry you!
This is war! Let's show those Titans just how powerful we humans are!
Time isn't on our side. Hurry it up!
Okay, I'm in.
Please don't take any unnecessary risks.
This may only be a small victory, but one day we will wipe out the Titans!
Phew, we held out.
Looks like we got away.
It's not an ideal outcome, but I'll take it.
We did it! This victory is a new start for mankind!
That smoke signal... So we've failed the mission?
I... We...have failed...all mankind.
This is the power of the Scout Regiment!
Ugh. They'll be having us for lunch at this rate.
Ready for action!
Don't look back!
They could do with some support.
I'll save our comrades!
I'll defend this area! Not a single Titan will pass!
I'd better team up.
Advance! Go!
Help our comrades! Hurry!
Save our comrades! Now!
Defend the area. Are you up to it?
See that?! We did it!
No, mission failed.
Aborting the mission.
Whatever it takes, I will stop the enemy!
We don't stand a chance!
Each mission brings us closer to mankind's collective triumph!
Being sent off to fight so suddenly must be tough on this season's recruits.
As long as your pals have your back, things will work out.
I don't have much to say about the commander and the lieutenant, but I trust them!
The price for a lapse in judgment is high. I must be vigilant.
