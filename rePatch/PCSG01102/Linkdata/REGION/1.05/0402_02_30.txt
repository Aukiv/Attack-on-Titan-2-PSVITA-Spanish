If you think I've only been building walls for the past five years, you're wrong!
I've got my own unit in the Garrison Regiment! I don't go down easy!
See that? Dropped that thing like a log! Boy, the booze is gonna flow tonight!
Haha! And I thought Titans like you were outta my league!
I don't care how strong my opponent may be, I'm not running away anymore!
Be careful! It's an Abnormal!
A distress call?! We have to get over there!
Our comrades are in danger. I'm on my way!
Thanks, I owe you one.
Th-Thank you!
Preciate it, [0:HERO_FAMN]! You have grit for a youngster!
Tonight's drinks are on me, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Oh, wait. You're a minor.
You've inspired this old man to fight, [0:HERO_FSTN]! I'll repay the favor someday.
It's good to have courage, but don't be in a hurry to die.
I was just in the right place at the right time!
It seems I owe you in addition to your father, Eren!
Glad to be fighting with you, Mikasa. That Titan might as well have been a toddler!
Appreciate it, Armin. Just don't go dying for me!
Thank you, ma'am. It's an honor to receive an assist from the Elite Squad.
Thanks for the help! Hey, you don't look so hot. You okay?
Don't sweat it, Eren! After all, without you three who's gonna make trouble for me?
What's wrong, Mikasa? You're usually two steps ahead in a fight!
Think before acting, Armin. That's your strong suit, no?


Wow! Not too shabby!
Well done! We'll take your lead!
I see you're a survivor too, [0:HERO_FAMN].
You're on a roll, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Keep at it!
With you at the fore, [0:HERO_FSTN], peace will be ours soon enough!
You're more headstrong than you were as a brat, Eren!
You get better by the day, Mikasa! Not to mention you were skilled to begin with.
Attaboy, Armin! Use that noggin of yours to steer your friends on the right course.
That's a Garrison Regiment ace for you. Fights like it's art!
What a soldier. Definitely not a beginner-contrary to the rumors.
That was one hell of a Titan...and yours truly ended him! Bahaha!
And another one bites the dust. Those are some unbelievable skills!
You're a brave one, [0:HERO_FAMN]. That Titan was dead the second you saw him.
Nice one, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Show me that move later, eh?
You're practically invincible, [0:HERO_FSTN]! I bet you could stick it to the bastards who broke the wall!
Someone, lend a hand!
I need some support here!
I'm coming! Hold on!
I'm coming to help!
This can't be...how it ends...for me.
Please get me out of this!
Get back! I'll take care of this!
I can't let anyone else die! I have to hurry!
Hey, you okay?
Are you all right?!
Yeah, I don't go down that easily.
I just got lucky. Let's go.
Sorry, I haven't got any fight left in me.
This is as far as I go. Falling back!
The Garrison Regiment will provide support!
I'm here to help! Is everyone okay?!
Are you all ready? Be safe out there!
I'm gonna show ya just what this drunk is made of.
In this line of work, death's always around the corner. Keep laying it on 'em!
Just hang on until we can get to you!
Stay on them! We can't let them get away!
We have to stand our ground at all costs!
Don't overthink it! Just run!
Eliminate the Titans and restore peace to the world!
There's hardly any time! Get a move on!
I'm ready for this!
I've got this!
Haha! What a victory! I didn't see that coming!
Yeah! We held out! 
I made it! I just wish I could say the same for everyone else.
That was a close call. I'm just grateful to be alive.
This victory has brought us one step closer to peace!
We failed... What a waste of life.
There's still so much...I need to do.
Nice! Keep the pressure on!
There's no way we can turn the tide now.
Okay, time to see some action!
Advancing! Here goes!
Leave the support to me!
We can't abandon them!
I will not give up my ground!
Joining forces.
Advance! Stop for nothing!
I need you to support our comrades!
Help them now! Move!
Don't let the Titans break through!
We did it! Mission accomplished!
Damn. We had a lot riding on this...
There's nothing else we can do. Aborting mission.
Leave it to me! I have to do it!
It's all been for nothing.
Hey, some leftover rations. Score! ...Yep. Not terrible, not tasty either-same slop as always.
Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are strong. They're all armed with different tools to survive.
Dr. Jaeger... Where in the hell'd you run off to?
Maybe it was just a false peace, but I'll do whatever it takes to get those days back.
I miss the days when I was just a good-for-nothing drunkard of a soldier.
