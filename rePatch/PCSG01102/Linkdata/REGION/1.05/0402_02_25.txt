The Titans' advantage lies in their numbers. Let's thin them a little.
Another one down! On to the next target!
I wasn't expecting one that vicious. Glad I've still got all my limbs.
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
Fear humankind!
Be careful! It's an Abnormal!
That smoke signal... It's a distress call!
That smoke signal?! We have to hurry!
I got through it, thanks to you.
Thank you! I hate to think what would have happened if you hadn't come.
Sorry for the trouble, [0:HERO_FAMN]. I'll pick up the slack now.
Thanks, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Knowing you have my six makes all the difference.
There you are, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Getting saved by you is getting to be a habit.
Don't let your guard down just yet. There are still more Titans.
I just did what's best for the mission.
Thanks, Jaeger. I'll be fine. Return to prioritizing the mission.
You saved me, Ackermann. I trust you'll do the same for the others.
Thanks. I'm glad to be serving alongside you.
Commander?! I'm not worthy of this honor!

I think you're a very capable leader, Ian.
Well said, Mitabi. We function as a squad, not as individuals.
Thank you, Commander! But I fear you give me too much credit.
It's all thanks to you allotting us sufficient time to train, sir!
I'm not nearly as tough as you think. Desperate, perhaps.
Nice job.
Outstanding.
You're far nimbler than any recruit I've seen, [0:HERO_FAMN]. What kind of training did they put you through?
I know you're capable of even more, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Keep at it!
With you in our ranks, [0:HERO_FSTN], mankind's victory is no longer a fantasy.
Hundreds of soldiers have put their lives on the line for yours. Show them their risk has meaning.
You were right. Your specialty is rending flesh.
That's what makes us elites.
That's the captain for you. He moves like silk in the wind.
Astounding work, Commander. Under your watch, the south is an impenetrable stronghold.
A human defeating a Titan as strong as that... It's unbelievable.
That was extraordinary! You're a role model for us all.
Wow, you actually pulled that off, [0:HERO_FAMN]. But don't let it go to your head.
That's no fluke. That was all you, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Impressive!
You absolutely minced that juggernaut, [0:HERO_FSTN]! You're the regiment's new secret weapon.
I'm a little short handed here! I need support!
I could do with some backup!
I won't allow them to die.
I've got your back!
I'll fight...until my last breath.
I need support right now!
Hang on! I'm not letting you die in vain!
I'll be right there!
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
I see you're still alive and kicking.
I'm fine.
I came this far just to slip up...?!
There's no need to overdo it. I'm going to fall back.
Right on time, it seems.
Leave the rest to me!
Titans sighted up ahead! Engage!
Feel the power of the Elite Squad!
It's your turn to fear us, Titans!
Don't let them die in vain! We have to save them!
The chase is on! Don't let a single one escape!
Hold this area to the last man! Not one of those things gets through!
All units, retreat! Don't even attempt to fight!
Today, humanity will defeat the Titans! Move out!
There's no time to lose! Hurry!
The Elite Squad must always fight with composure.
Ready for action!
Mission complete. Well done, team.
We did it. We held the Titans at bay.
Withdrawal complete! But don't forget those who lost their lives.
Our losses were too great to celebrate this victory.
This victory was made possible by our fallen!
Ordered to retreat?! Have we failed the mission?
No...! Will our losses have been for nothing?!
It's been clear sailing so far.
Why isn't this going according to plan?!
Time to start the mission!
Advancing.
Providing backup.
Going to the rescue.
Leave the defense up to me.
I'm going to team up.
Begin our advance!
Support our comrades!
Rescue our comrades!
Tighten our defenses!
Mission complete!
Mission failed!
Mission aborted!
I'm not letting things end like this!
What will it take for us to beat the Titans?
Being a soldier, I'm prepared to give my life. But that doesn't mean I don't have an opinion.
The regiment is stretched thin, but we fight nonetheless. Soldiers and time are resources not to be squandered.
I'll fight to my last breath if it means teaching those Titans to fear mankind.
I wonder how many humans will lose their lives in this battle.
If there's even the slightest chance, we have to seize it.
