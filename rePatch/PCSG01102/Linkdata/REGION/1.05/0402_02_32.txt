Cutting up Titans is the very thing I TEACH! 'Course I can do it myself!
Ooh, I feel young again!
That was a big one. Call it luck, I guess.
That one had more bark than bite. Smashed right through him.
That's definitely not your normal Titan.
We've got an Abnormal on our hands! I take it you maggots know what to do?!
It's a distress call! Handle it!
Can't you see the smoke signal? There's not a moment to lose!
I appreciate your assistance.
Thank you for the assist.
That was you, [0:HERO_FAMN]? Guess I owe you.
Thanks, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I can tell you've improved!
I won't forget this, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You're going to do great things!
Do you actually WANT to die? Get your head out of your ass!
Hope I didn't cross a line, sir. I'm only here to help.
You're a gifted solider, Elwin. You've got a knack for gauging the big picture.
I didn't expect a save from you. Thanks, I suppose.
You sure as hell aren't green anymore. Good job.
Thanks, Levi. I see why Elwin trusts you.
Nicely handled, recruit. Say, I remember you. Where are you from again?
Actually, sir, I was much better in my younger days as a Scout.
I didn't make you commander so you could get offed by some random Titan!



Excellent judgment! Don't let your standards slip!
That is how it should be done.
I like the fire in those eyes, [0:HERO_FAMN]! They say you've seen your share of hell.
Impressive, [0:HERO_FSTN]. When did you pick up that maneuver?
You're a beacon to humanity, [0:HERO_FSTN]-and you're gonna kill every last one of these Titans dead!
Grisha... You're son's a proud soldier now.
You're a damned fighting genius, Ackermann-without precedent!
Appointing you commander is my greatest, and only, military exploit.
Almost doubted my eyes there! You've changed quite a bit, and in such a short span.
You're what, section commander now? You do your rank honor.
Defeating such a Titan... It would appear that an extraordinary talent is coming into bloom.
Absolutely splendid! You are a model soldier to the young recruits, sir!
That's exactly how you take care of the big ones! A fine kill, by the book, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
That your work, [0:HERO_FSTN]? The front lines have molded you into a true warrior!
A beautiful victory, [0:HERO_FSTN]! No Titan can devour you!
I've got my hands full! Back me up!
Requesting support!
Roger. Heading your way now.
Support's on the way.
So this is how I go? Before seeing the mission through...?
I'm outmatched. Assist me!
Looks like I'm needed. Charging ahead!
I'm coming! Don't let it be too late...!
Looks like you aren't Titan fodder yet.
So you made it after all.
Yeah, it's too soon to die just yet.
Looks like I'll live to see another day.
Don't die on me now...
You guys can handle the rest.
Can someone tell me what the hell's going on here?!
Never thought I'd have to fight on the front lines, too..
Put your training into action! All units, engage!
Let me show you what my years in the Survey Corps taught me!
We're gonna make it through this alive!
Did I ever teach you to abandon an ally?
Beat them down before they can get away!
Form a wall and stop that Titan!
We'll mount a counterattack later! For now we retreat!
Put your hearts into this, everyone! This is our final fight!
Here we go! Make every second count!
I'll help, too.
I'll do whatever I can.
We've achieved our mission! You should be proud!
That was amazing! Way to form a good defense!
We made it! They're not gonna chase us any further.
Was that really a victory? We lost so many...
You're done already? Impressive...!
Sometimes retreat is the best option when all else fails...
I knew it... I'm too weak to change anything.
With this much skill we might just be alright.
How is this happening? Didn't you learn anything from me...?
This is where all your hard work in training pays off!
CHARGE!
I think you need my protection.
I'm bringing backup!
Stop the Titans!
I see some comrades over there... I'm gonna need the extra manpower if I plan on moving at all.
Advance! Don't fall behind!
Provide support!
Save our comrades!
Assume a defensive position!
Mission accomplished! Well done!
We have failed the mission!
Aborting mission!
Watch and learn! This is how you fight 'em!
An average man like me...can't accomplish anything...
I'll never do anything but watch from the sidelines. Special people are the only ones who can change anything.
The Scout Regiment exists because people don't trust the King's policy of staying within the Walls.
People who aren't special can never hope to accomplish anything important...
This takes me back to my days in the Scout Regiment.
I trained you as hard as I could so you wouldn't die in vain on the battlefield.
