Eh. Not bad, I guess.
We've cleared out a good number, but I smell more.
That was no normal Titan we put down. I knew he smelled weird.
What a beast! One whiff is one too many!
Hmph... So that's what I could smell.
It's an Abnormal.
A distress call! Moving out!
Uh oh. We've got friends in need.
Do you think you helped? Then I'll thank you.
Sorry for the trouble.
*sniff* I smell great potential in you, [0:HERO_FAMN].
Thanks for the save, [0:HERO_FSTN]!
Appreciate it, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Seems like you're always saving my ass!
I just hope you can carry on fighting.
I smelled that you were in trouble.
Sorry, Commander. I know you have more important work to attend to.
Thanks for the assist. I'm sure it doesn't have ANYTHING to do with potential specimens in the area, right?
Sorry. A strange scent caught me off guard.
Thanks, Gelgar.
Much obliged, Nanaba. But I'm saving you next-got it?
Don't mention it Erwin. After all, we go way back.
Thanks, Hange. I'm flattered.
You okay, Levi? You're not one to slip up like that.
C'mon, Gelgar. You should be able to slay Titans like those in your sleep.
Doing okay, Nanaba? Nothing broken? Then back in you go!
Keep up the good work.
An admirable effort.
Nice, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Glad to see one of you took training seriously.
Good work, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Say, are you really a recruit...?
Someone get [0:HERO_FSTN] here a damn medal! Those are some skills!
On point as always, Erwin. You never change.
Good one, Hange. Devote this much to every battle and you'll outlive us all.
Guess that title of "mankind's strongest" isn't just for show.
Ever the brawler, Gelgar. I like it! Heheh.
Hange's lucky to have a subordinate like you, Moblit.
An excellent job of stopping a very powerful Titan.
There aren't many people who could pull off a feat like that.
What the... That's not the work of a fresh recruit!
You have a knack for sniffing out targets!
Pah! That enemy was beneath you.
Damn, I need support over here!
I have to get through this somehow.
I'm coming!
Better hurry.
Someone...help...or I'm...dead.
Can't hold 'em off! I need help, ASAP!
Hang on! I'll be right there!
Damn, I can't lose another comrade.
I see you're still alive.
Are you all right?
As you can see.
Yeah, at least for now.
This is...my limit.
Now is the time.
*sniff* This smell means it's go time.
I made it. I've got your backs!
Ready for battle!
Now this is a new scent. Come on out-I smell you!
Don't give up! As long as we're fighting, we haven't lost!
Rescue them, whatever it takes. This is our mission.
Vile Titans, you think you can run away from my nose?
Don't let the Titans set foot in this area!
There's no use fighting in vain! Just make it back alive!
Humans or Titans. This battle will determine who this world belongs to.
We're up against the clock! Get a move on!
We will accomplish our mission, no matter how fierce the battle.
Ready for action!
Looks like it's over.
We made it.
We lost them.
We won... If we can call this a victory.
Is humankind finally victorious?
The mission is not viable. Yet more good soldiers have died for nothing.
This can't be...
The situation is definitely in our favor.
They're overwhelming us.
It's time. Starting the mission.
Advance!
I'm going to help them!
Saving our comrades is our highest priority.
I'll wait for the Titans here.
Going to team up!
Advance!
Provide support!
Save them!
Stop the Titans!
Mission accomplished.
We failed the mission?!
We have no choice but to abandon the mission.
Humankind will only lose when we stop fighting!
How many lives will have to be lost before this is over?
The instant man stops fighting-he has lost.
I've got a good nose, sure. But it can't hold a candle to Elwin's.
Oh, it's you.
I can pinpoint the location of most Titans by scent alone.
Am I considered a veteran? Most of my old comrades are dead.
