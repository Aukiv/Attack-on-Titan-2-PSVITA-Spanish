I will carry out my duty as a soldier!
I'm not scared of a few Titans!
We won... But it certainly wasn't easy.
I thought I was a goner...but I did it.
Whoa, what the hell is that?
Such odd movement... It might be an Abnormal!
Damn. Our friends aren't doing well.
They'll be wiped out if we don't hurry!
Thanks. It was almost lights out for me.
I appreciate your help!
Sorry for the trouble, [0:HERO_FAMN]. And thanks.
With you here, [0:HERO_FSTN], the rest should be a cakewalk.
Saved my skin again, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You're the best.
I just did my duty as a soldier.
My training just kicked in.
Thanks, Bertholdt. One day, we'll be back home. I promise.
Just in the nick of time. Thanks, Annie.
Thanks, Christa. Uh... Marry me?
You're the last person I'd expect help from. You feeling okay, Ymir?
It's about damn time! I was THIS close to being a corpse, Eren!
Damn straight. I didn't come all this way to die!
Gratitude? From you? I think that's a first.
E-e-excuse me? I don't have a clue what you're talking about!
I've got your back, Conny!
Don't mention it. What're friends for, eh? F-friends...
Nicely done! Keep it up!
Spectacular! The Titans are no match.
Slick work, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Just don't overdo it.
Nice, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Keep it up and they'll soon be extinct.
You're a model soldier, [0:HERO_FSTN]. There's a lot I can learn from you.
You're good at this, you know that? Don't hold back. Go the distance.
Hats off, Annie. I can see you were born to win.
Nice one, Ymir. Now I KNOW you're holding back when we train.
Looking good, Armin. You've improved. I had no idea.
Christa, I'm impressed. But don't go risking your neck more than you need to.
You showed that one who's boss! Nice!
Woohoo! You must be superhuman!
Holy hell, [0:HERO_FAMN]. You canned that thing yourself?
You're the real deal, [0:HERO_FSTN]. It's an honor to serve with you.
Geez, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I'd hate to catch you on a bad day...
I'm in over my head. Where are the reinforcements?
I need reinforcements!
Hang on! I'm on my way!
Got it. I'm heading over!
This is going from bad to worse... Someone, get over here!
Situation critical. Reinforcements, please!
I'm on my way. You'd better not die on me!
I'm coming to you! Just hang on a little longer!
Looks like you'll be fine!
What's the situation like here?
Right, let's finish up here.
It seems I'm not dead yet. Let's resume the mission.
It's no good... Retreating!
I've done my job... Withdrawing!
Did someone ask for help?!
Miserable Titans, I've been waiting for you!
Fulfill your duty as soldiers!
I'll show you the way a soldier should be.
There are times when a soldier can't retreat. Now's one of them!
Hurry! We've gotta save them!
They ain't getting away! After them!
Don't let those murderous Titans past you!
Move! Get away from them!
Victory is ours for the taking!
There's no time to waste! Get a move on!
Right, let's go!
Okay, I've got this!
I've fulfilled my duty as a soldier.
They were never gonna get past me!
It looks like they aren't chasing us anymore.
Looks like the Titans have run away with their tails between their legs!
We won! Now I can finally go back to my hometown.
We can't continue this mission... Fall back.
Am I going to die without seeing my hometown again?
We have the upper hand! Mow 'em down!
They're all over us... What should we do?
How about we put some money on this mission?!
Time to advance!
I've gotta support our comrades!
I'm gonna save them!
Everything hangs on holding this line!
I'd better team up!
Advance!
You're on backup!
Our friends are in danger. Go!
Defend to the last man!
Job well done!
Damn... We messed up.
The situation's gotten out of hand. Aborting mission!
I've just gotta do what I do best!
I don't think I can get back into this fight.
I have one goal, and one goal only-returning home.
Bertholdt and I go way back. Great guy. He gets the job done.
Christa's nicer to me than the others. I think...I think she likes me.
Now I must try to be the best soldier I can be.
I've been close to death so many times... At this rate, I don't have long left for this world.
