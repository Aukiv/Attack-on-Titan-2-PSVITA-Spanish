That enough? I've done my part.
Not bad.
Pitting a helpless girl against these monstrosities... What are they thinking?
You came at me with everything you had; I just responded in kind.
This one seems very ferocious.
That's an Abnormal.
We should go and help.
They're in a bad way. Can we make it in time?
Thank you.
Thank you for your assistance.
Come to rescue a damsel in distress? I'm flattered, [0:HERO_FAMN].
As far as people go, [0:HERO_FSTN]-you're okay.
You're here, [0:HERO_FSTN]? Guess that means I'm saved.
Anytime.
Don't mention it.
Thanks, Reiner. I owe you one.
Nice timing, Bertholdt. I might've been a stain on the ground if you hadn't come.
Thanks, Armin. You do pretty well for yourself...being weak and all.
Hm. I guess today's full of surprises.
Thanks, Eren. I'll return the favor one of these days.
Stop making me work so hard, Reiner.
What are you gawking at? This is war. Fight already!
"Care" is a bit strong.
Please. This is my job.
I'm not angry. Just mildly annoyed I had to save your ass.
Well done.
That's what sets you apart from the recruits.
You've got moxie, [0:HERO_FAMN].
Impressive, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You move like a natural.
I didn't give you enough credit, [0:HERO_FSTN]. You're gutsy. I like that.
Nice maneuver, Reiner. Been practicing?
You're pumped today, Bertholdt. Something special happen?
You're a beast, Mikasa...more so than those in the woods.
Great work out there, Armin. I mean, for you, anyway.
You fight pretty well, considering all the slacking you do.
You beat that thing? ...Nice.
Done like a true veteran.
Good hustle out there, [0:HERO_FAMN]. You took that thing down hard.
Pretty good, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Your skills are the real deal.
You made that look like a walk in the park, [0:HERO_FSTN].
I'm getting creamed. Help, please.
This is getting perilous... I need reinforcements.
I'll lend a hand.
I'm coming.
Tsk. Trapped like a rat...
I don't stand a chance. I need reinforcements.
Looks like someone needs help ASAP.
I'm on my way. Just hold on.
I see you're still alive.
Are you okay? I'll join you.
It looks like you're all right.
I'll live.
I think I screwed up.
I've had enough. I'm out of here.
I'm here to provide support.
It looks like I'm just in time.
Here goes.
Maybe it's good to have a distraction every now and then.
I don't want to die in a place like this.
We have to help.
Can we catch up with them?
I'll do everything I can to defend this place.
We need to get a move on.
I guess I need to give this everything I've got.
There's no time to hesitate.
Okay.
Yes.
Are you happy now?
We held them at bay.
We got away.
We won. Even so...
I guess this is good news.
We've failed.
I didn't have what it takes.
This one's in the bag.
The Titans are going to overrun us.
Okay, let's get started.
Okay, shall we advance?
I'll provide support.
I guess I should go and help.
Looks like we're on defense.
I'll join you.
Okay, advance!
Provide support.
Help them.
Defend to your last breath.
That went well.
We failed.
Abort the mission.
Time to get down to business.
I never thought we'd end up in such a desperate situation.
Learning hand-to-hand combat won't count for jack in a Titan fight.
Maybe being swept away by the current is part of being ordinary.
Eren's got the wrong idea about me. I'm just a girl-frail and fragile.
I'm tired of playing soldier in this broken world. That rap's for morons.
I want to survive. I'm simply obeying that drive.
