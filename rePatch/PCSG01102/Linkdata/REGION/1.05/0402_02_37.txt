I, I did it...! I defeated it!
You think I'm gonna die in a place like this...?!
I beat that thing...? It's a miracle...
Ulp! ...Huh? Oh, I won, haha...
It looks so strong... I feel sick...
An Abnormal Titan?! I think I'm gonna be sick...
Looks like a close fight... I can't just sit here doing nothing...
Crap, this looks bad... I don't want any part of this...
Th-thanks...you saved me.
Th-Thank you!
[0:HERO_FAMN]! Could you get here a little quicker next time...?
So it was you who rescued me, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Sorry to put you through that...
Sorry, [0:HERO_FSTN]... I'll get stronger so this doesn't happen again...!
I'm just glad I was able to pull that off...
Oh, it was nothing...haha...
Thanks, Sasha... You're the only reason I didn't get eaten...
If it hadn't been for you, Marco, I...I... AGHH!
I can't count the number of times you've saved me, Christa...
Thomas... I'm so sorry. You must've been terrified back there.
Sorry, Mina... You didn't have to put yourself in harm's way for me.
It was nothing, Thomas. I just didn't wanna watch you get eaten.
I'm glad I could help, Marco. But I was ready to bolt if things got dangerous...
No problem... Now let's just get this over with and go home...


Amazing...
With someone like that around I might not get eaten...
[0:HERO_FAMN]! You are amazing!
You really are amazing, [0:HERO_FSTN]... Unlike me.
You're doing great, [0:HERO_FSTN]... I should follow your example.
That's...Bertholdt! He may not stand out, but there's no question about his skills...
Marco draws the eyes of everyone around him... I could never keep my cool long enough to be like him.
Christa's amazing... She's always working as hard as she can for others...
What...? When did Thomas get so good at this?!
Look at Mina... Even Keith would be surprised...
How did you...do that...?
Amazing... I can't believe you pulled that off...
I can't believe what you just did, [0:HERO_FAMN]...
You're so calm, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I always freak out and can't do anything... 
I really respect your strength, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I should try harder, too...!
H-help! Somebody, come quick!
H-help me, please! I can't do this alone!
I'm coming!
G-got it! I'm coming!
Oh no... I'm gonna be eaten...!
I'm done for... They're going to eat me...!
H-hang in there! Crap, what do I do...?
Oh no! Wh-what should I do...?
Are you hurt?
Are you alright?
I'm not Titan food yet...
I'm still alive somehow...
Better to run than be eaten...
That's enough... I'm outta here!
Urgh... There are still Titans left...
I can't run away... I'm gonna do this!
En-engage!
Even I like to join the fray sometimes!
We'll never be able to... No! I can't give up!
I gotta help... They're my comrades after all...!
If I don't chase them now, I'll get in trouble later no matter what I say...
All we have to do is stand our ground... I can do this!
Retreat! Hurry and get out of here!
I have to do this...to protect my family!
There's not much time... I'd better hurry!
G-got it! I'm on it!
R-roger that! I'm on my way!
We won... I didn't get eaten!
Our defenses held... We win!
We escaped...! I can't move another inch...
Well...we didn't lose, at least...
We won... We finally won!
All troops to retreat? Does that mean we lost...?
They're gonna eat us... I'm sorry...
We're making headway... We just might win!
They're too much... I'll never beat them...
Ready to get this started...
I'm scared, but I'll still move forward!
I'll provide some p-protection...
They're gonna get eaten... I gotta help!
N-no one's getting past me!
Looks like I need to team up...
F-full charge ahead!
Somebody give them cover!
Our comrade needs help!
Protect that spot!
Our mission was a success!
No...we failed...
Our mission failed... We've no choice but to abort.
We didn't fight our way this far just to get eaten!
This fighting is meaningless... What's the point in it all?
I'd like to spend humanity's last moments with my family...
Seeing my friends get eaten before my eyes, all I could think was how glad I was it wasn't me...
Isn't it our job to fight until we get eaten?
We're more than just disposable blades to be used up and thrown away...
I've been through tough training like every other soldier. And I'm prepared to fight for my family...
