Chalk that one up to teamwork.
This is how I serve the King.
Whew. Glad that's over.
All right! ...Is everyone okay?
That's not your average Titan. I'll draw him out. Everyone else, stay sharp!
Is that...an Abnormal? We need to be careful.
Distress call sighted! I'm on my way!
Are they in trouble?! We need to get to them!
Thanks.
Thank you for your assistance.
You came, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
You saved me, [0:HERO_FSTN]! You're the greatest.
Thanks, [0:HERO_FSTN]. How many times have you saved me now? I've lost count!
Don't worry about it. We're a team, after all.
I'm glad I could help.
Thanks a bunch, Jean! I'll try to play it safe.
Thanks, Thomas. Almost got turned into Titan food there.
I can't thank you enough, Bertholdt. You've really got it together!
...Daz? Is that you? Talk about pleasant surprises!
Thank you, sir! It's an honor to be assisted by the Commander of the Military Police.
It's the least I could do, Jean. But look before you leap next time!
Sounds good. But first, let's get home in one piece!
Friends look out for each other. Glad you're okay, Mina!
Thanks! But there are plenty others who'd make better leaders than me.
That means a lot, Conny. You know I'd never leave you behind.
That's some incredible maneuvering.
I see I still have so much to learn.
You're a natural, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
Looking sharp, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Have you been training on the side?
Hats off to you, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Now I have something to strive for!
That's some mean speed, Jean! Train with me next time?
Great work, Armin! That was art in motion!
Nice going, Reiner! You always come through.
You're hero of the day, Mina! Show me that move sometime, will you?
That's Commander Nile for you-a living legend.
I can't believe you killed such a powerful Titan. Amazing.
What a show! It's so inspiring to see a veteran in action!
You did that thing in, [0:HERO_FAMN]? Unbelievable.
Your strength is a gift to mankind, [0:HERO_FSTN].
You never cease to amaze, [0:HERO_FSTN]! You'll be a great soldier one day.
Can someone lend a hand?
Can I ask for some reinforcements?
That looks bad. I'm on my way!
Understood. I'll be right there!
Is this...the end...for me?
I can't...hold on...much longer.
No! I have to help!
Not good. Hold on, I'm coming!
Are you still in one piece?
How are you? Are you hurt?
I'm fine, thanks.
I'm okay. I can still fight!
I have to get out of here.
I'm done for now. Retreating!
Looks like I made it. Time to fight!
Are you guys still kicking? I'm here to help!
Engage the enemy! Don't let up for a second!
Let this battle demonstrate our allegiance to the throne!
Things are looking grim. But there's no giving up now!
Hang on! We'll save you!
Don't let them get away! Move!
I'm defending this area, whatever it takes!
We have to retreat, but can all of us make it?
Today we will be victorious. For the King!
We don't have much time! Get a move on!
Yeah, let's go!
I'm with you!
Yeah! We won!
We did it. We held out.
It looks like we got away in one piece.
I survived. Right now I'm grateful for just that.
I dedicate this victory to the King!
We failed. I could have done better.
My fight...is over.
We've got them on the run! This is in the bag!
No! They're pushing us back!
Okay, let's get the mission started.
Beginning our advance!
I'm going to support our comrades.
Our comrades are in danger! I'm going to save them!
I'll defend this area to the very end!
Let's link up with the others.
Begin our advance! Go!
Provide some backup. Go!
Saving our comrades is our top priority! Move out!
Defend the area! I'm counting on you!
We are victorious! Good job, team!
Damn, we failed.
It's impossible to continue this mission.
For the King, I will never give up!
Did we ever stand a chance of winning?
I may not be as nimble as everyone, but I have my own strengths.
Eren and Jean are always at each other's throats. They should try talking it out.
My ODM gear's in top condition thanks to that tune-up session with Armin.
I want to join the Military Police and devote myself to serving the King.
There are some things that only weak people truly understand.
