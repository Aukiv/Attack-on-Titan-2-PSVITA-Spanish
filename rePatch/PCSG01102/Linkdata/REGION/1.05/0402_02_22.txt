That was a fair number taken out. I'd say we've contributed.
Begone from this world, you vile Titans!
Ha! Take humans lightly and you'll get torn to ribbons.
Now you know the power of the Scout Regiment!
I'm not optimistic about taking this one on.
An Abnormal. I've got this!
To the signal! Our allies need assistance!
We have to get to them before they're wiped out!
I appreciate your help.
Thank you! I'll be careful from now on!
You're a new recruit-came in with Eren, right? Thanks for the assist.
You saved me, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I'll be sure to repay the favor.
[0:HERO_FSTN]...! You're a saint. Thanks.
We all need help sometimes.
Please fall back if it gets to be too much.
Much obliged, Captain! I'm fine now.
Thanks for the save. Am I glad we're in the same squad!
We should be the ones saving you... Anyway-appreciate it, Eren!


Without you, Captain, this squad is nothing.
You've got quite the mouth on you now, Oruo, but remember your first mission? You were shaking in your boots!
Don't mention it, Petra. You've got the most assists under your belt. We need you!
I can see you're fully functional. Let's hit 'em hard, Gunther!

Very good! My turn next!
You're in excellent form today.
Commendable, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Just remember to look before you leap.
I don't surprise easy, but wow, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Show me more!
Skilled soldiers like you are this regiment's future, [0:HERO_FSTN]!
No one can hold a candle to the captain... I'll do my damned best to support him, though!
Looking good out there. I'll do my part for the squad too!
I had my doubts about you in the beginning-but now I see how much of an asset to humanity you are, Eren!
He's a brilliant strategist and one of the toughest Titan-slayers around. There's no better choice for commander of the Scout Regiment.
Wow. I see the Garrison Regiment has a star of its own.
You killed that monster?! I can't believe it!
I knew you were strong, but that was unbelievable.
Splendid work, [0:HERO_FAMN]. Just don't push it. Being wary of your opponent is a skill in itself.
Another kill, [0:HERO_FSTN]? You've shed that new recruit recklessness too. Good!
You're a beast, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Not sure if I could've downed that one myself.
Can I get some help over here?
This is too much. A little help please!
That sounds bad. I have to help.
I'm coming to help!
I'm just going to hold everyone back.
Sorry to ask, but please help me!
I'll help! Can you carry on?
Don't be in such a hurry to reach the next life.
How are you? Can you still fight?
I'm glad to see you're still in one piece.
Fine. I'm good to go.
No need to worry about me.
I'm done. Retreating!
I can't take any more risks. I'm falling back.
Sorry for the wait.
I see the situation still hasn't been resolved. Here goes!
Right, let's get this mission over and done with!
Fight your hearts out! Don't regret not giving it everything you've got!
Just don't let yourselves get killed for nothing! Fight with all your might and survive!
We have to save them, however great the risk.
Don't let them get away! Move, as fast as you can!
Focus on defense! Halt the Titans!
We just have to get the hell out of here! Avoid any unnecessary conflict!
Now it's time to settle things once and for all!
And the remaining time left is... Uh oh. Just hurry!
Don't lose sight of our objective.
I'll make sure we accomplish any mission!
As least we've won this battle, if not yet the war.
Let's just be grateful we held our ground.
We managed to escape. Hopefully next time it'll be us doing the chasing.
There are positives to be found even in situations like this.
This is a major step forward! For us and for all humanity!
Mission failed. I didn't have what it takes.
Someone...avenge me.
We've got them on the ropes.
We don't stand a chance of winning. Shouldn't we retreat?!
I'll see this mission through to the end!
Advancing towards our objective!
We'd better bail out our friends.
Someone, save them!
There's no way they're getting through here!
I'm going to team up.
Advance! Don't look back!
Provide support! I'm relying on you!
Help them now!
I'm relying on you to hold the area!
Job well done!
What a disaster. Time for a rethink!
We've been forced to abort this mission.
I'll do anything and everything it takes to kill the Titans!
In the end...we just aren't strong enough.
A soldier's worth isn't decided by their kill count. Pulling your friends out of a pinch is important too.
I'm in charge of the squad when the captain's not around. I don't take that responsibility lightly.
No matter the situation, I place my full trust in the judgment of the captain and commander.
Individually we're weak...but when we come together, we are anything but!
I've lived through so many campaigns. There's no way I'm dying today!
