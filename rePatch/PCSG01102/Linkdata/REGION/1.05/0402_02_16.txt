Oh, yeah! Get a load of that?!
See that?! I think I'm getting good at this!
Did I really beat that thing...?!
No Titan will ever get the better of me!
What type of Titan is that?!
I've found an Abnormal! Watch yourselves!
A distress call?! Can we get to them in time?
Eesh. I'd better get over there!
Thanks.
Th-Thank you!
You came, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
Thanks, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I almost kicked the bucket.
Great timing, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Things are looking up now!
You can thank me later. Let's bury the bastards first!
It was nothing! Anytime!
Thanks, Jean. The thing almost had me.
Ymir? Now that's a surprise.
Thanks, Marco! You can count on me repaying the favor!
You're an angel, Mina. I'll be the one to save you next time.
Wow, Daz! Thanks to you, I get to keep my limbs!
You said it! No way I'm dying today!
Let's turn the tables on these walking freak shows!
Standing by while your friends get eaten-trust me, that's way scarier!


Look at you go! You're really raising the bar!
You veterans have some nice moves. Impressive stuff.
You're the man, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
You're tearing it up, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Keep going!
I see you, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Ever get tired of overachieving? Haha!
Nice work, Bertholdt! You're way stronger than you look.
Holy hell, Ymir! You're as cold-blooded as the Titans!
You're on fire, Mina! You'll be outranking us in no time!
Cool stuff, Jean. I can't wait to see more!
Now there's a forest girl for you-taking down Titans like they're dinner!
You defeated such a strong Titan?! No way!
Huh? How on earth did you do that?
What the... Did YOU do that, [0:HERO_FAMN]?
I never dreamed you'd become this beastly, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Respect!
You took that juggernaut down, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Way down!
Ugh. I screwed up. Bail me out?
Sorry, could you lend a hand?
You okay?! I'm coming!
I hear you! I'm on my way!
Is this how...it all ends...?
I'm done for. Someone, please help!
Don't give up! I'll help you!
Please no... I have to help!
Everything okay here?
Are you okay?
I'm glad you're not hurt.
I'm okay, thanks.
It's no good. I have to get out of here!
That's enough. I'm out of here.
Glad I made it. And now, we fight together!
I'll fight extra hard to make up for being late!
Here goes! Let battle commence!
Let's see which one of us can kill the most Titans!
There's no way I'm dying here!
We'll save you! Hang on!
Trying to run away, eh?! Not so fast!
We can't let a single Titan through.
We're dead meat if we stay here! Retreat!
I wonder how many Titans I'll bag this time!
Have we got any time left? We'd better move it!
Yeah, let's go!
Yeah, I can't wait!
We did it! We won!
Whew, we held out.
We escaped. I'm still alive.
Can we really call this a victory?
We beat the Titans!
Retreat? So we failed the mission?
Damn... How could we let this happen?
We're dominating this fight! Don't let up!
They're overwhelming us. It's not looking good.
Commencing the mission. I'll show 'em what for!
Right, advancing!
Our friends need help. C'mon.
Saving our comrades is our top priority!
Whatever happens, I will defend this area.
Going it alone would be a gamble. Rendezvousing with the others!
There's only one way, guys-forward!
Give support to our comrades!
Someone, go and save our comrades!
I'm relying on you to hold the area!
Yeah! Mission complete!
Dammit. We botched this thing.
There's no way we can continue this mission.
I'm going to show everyone just what I'm capable of!
We're done. Just...done.
Being that Jean and I are both from the Trost District, I can't let him steal my thunder!
I can't wait to take back Wall Maria-or more precisely, indulge in the lavish victory feast afterwards!
Eren's awesome. A huge asset. Weird how people were saying he had no talent as a cadet.
Even when you know what you have to do, there are times when you just can't find the resolve.
Once you decide to fight, you just have to prepare yourself for whatever comes.
