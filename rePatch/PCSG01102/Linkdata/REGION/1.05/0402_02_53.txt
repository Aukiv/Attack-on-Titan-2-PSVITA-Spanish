I always thought that we'd be safe as long as we remained within the Walls...





That smoke... I don't think it means anything good.
Hey, don't you need to go and help them?!
Thank you for helping me.

Thank you... I won't forget what you did!














Yeah! That's amazing!

You're amazing! I can't believe this!


Such a young solider, but still fighting on our behalf...




Killing such a powerful Titan... I'm speechless.

You killed that terrifying Titan...?! I can't believe it!


















Please, kill all the Titans as fast as you can!










Did you win? What a relief.








We can do anything if we put our minds to it!





You're soldiers. Get out in front!
Don't you need to help your comrades?
They're in trouble! Save them!
Defend this area, please.
Great, mission accomplished.
Mission failed? Is this it for us?
You have to abort the mission. There's no way you can carry on.


We can never hope to beat those Titans...
I always thought that we'd be safe as long as we remained within the Walls...
