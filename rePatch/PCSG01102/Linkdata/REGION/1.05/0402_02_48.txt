We're going to need backup...

I only won because I got lucky... That was close...

This one's gonna put up quite a fight. Stay alert.
Abnormal sighted. Be careful.
A distress call. I'm on it.
Uh-oh... I'd better hurry...
Thanks.
Thank you for the help.



It's not a big deal.
I'm glad you're okay.










Some nice moves you have there.
You're a fine example for us all.








An outstanding achievement.
If anyone could have done it, it was you.



I messed up. Can you lend a hand?
I'm injured. I need backup.
I'll be right there. Just hang on.
I'm on my way.
The outlook doesn't look good.
Please just leave me.
Don't worry... I'm coming to help you.
It's too early to give up just yet.
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. Let's go.
No problem. I'm on my way.
What an undignified end.
Mission complete. Falling back.
Engaging the enemy. I've got a lot of missed time to make up.

It's time to start the mission.
Let's tear those hulking lummoxes to pieces.
We have to stay calm especially when things get tough.
We never abandon our comrades, whatever happens.
Do you lumbering brutes think you can get away from us?!
If we can hold our ground, victory will be ours.
It's shameful that we have to run away with our tails between our legs.
Let's make it so those Titans never bother us ever again.
Time isn't on our side. Hurry!
Got it. I'm in.
Understood. I'll be there.
It went just as I calculated.
It seems we held our ground.
I got away unscathed. I will get my own back, sooner or later.
This is a draw, at best.
Humankind has exacted its revenge!
All units to withdraw? Does that mean we've failed the mission?
I always knew...this day would come...eventually.
We're dominating the flow of battle. We must seize this opportunity.
Things aren't going in our favor.
Let's start the mission.
I'll spearhead the advance.
I'll support our comrades.
Our comrades need... No, I'll go.
I'll defend this area.
I should team up.
Now, charge!
Support our comrades.
Save our comrades! Hurry!
I need you to hold that ground.
That mission went like clockwork.
How could we have failed? Did we lose focus?
It's impossible now. Aborting mission.
I can't let myself die until I've exterminated the Titans!
Our losses...are too great.
