You're not snacking on me today, Titans!
If they were animals, I'd have more meat than I could eat in a lifetime.
Close call... I thought I'd never savor another meal!
Now that we've taken care of something like that, I think we deserve a nice little reward!
That Titan... I have a very bad feeling about it.
It's an Abnormal. Please be careful!
Smoke signal sighted!
I have to hurry. I hope I make it in time!
Thanks!
I am most grateful!
You're my hero, [0:HERO_FAMN].
You saved me again. Are you...are you a god in disguise, [0:HERO_FSTN]?!
I live to eat again! Thank you, [0:HERO_FSTN]!
It was nothing!
If you have a reward in mind, something from the officers' food supplies might be nice!
Mikasaaaaa! Thank yooooou!
Appreciate it, Conny! I had a feeling you'd come!
I'll repay the favor! ...Well, I'll try.
Are you an angel...? Either way, thanks!
Thanks, Marco! Boy am I glad I'm in your squad!
Really?! ...No strings attached?
Hey, thanks! Bread, potatoes, meat...I'm not choosey!
Glad you're safe and sound, Christa. Now, let's wrap this up!
Will do!
Ah, life and its decisions... I think I'll take the bread.
Nice work!
I could never fight like that!
Killer work out there, [0:HERO_FAMN]!
You're in the zone, [0:HERO_FSTN]! But I can take care of business too!
Smooth, [0:HERO_FSTN]! You might have what it takes to run with us hunters!
My compliments, Ymir!
Wow, you ARE a pro at this, Conny!
Great work, Mina! ...Unrelated, but I have a feeling dinner will be spectacular.
The Military Police are really on-point! ...You guys don't get better grub than us, right?
You're a beast, Mikasa. A feral, gliding beast lady!
You picked that thing apart without batting an eye!
I knew you had what it takes to hunt such formidable prey.
You took that Titan to town, [0:HERO_FAMN]! Nice!
Incredible! You left that behemoth in pieces, [0:HERO_FSTN]!
Woo! Look at you, [0:HERO_FSTN]! You'd make a fine hunter, you know?
Someone, lend a hand!
Please, I need support!
Please hang on! I'll be there soon!
Got it! I'm on my way!
I'm a goner! Help me-please!
I'm done for. Help me!
I have to help before it's too late!
I'd better get over there-and fast!
Are you all right?
What's the situation here?
You seem okay, too!
I'm okay. Let's go!
This is my limit. I'm going to retreat.
I've bitten off more than I can chew. I need to withdraw.
I made it in time! Okay, here goes!
Sasha Braus to the rescue!
C'mon, guys! Let's hustle!
This smell... The hunt is on! I'm going to eat my prey!
I'll show you just how scary a cornered animal can be.
Please let them be okay!
Be a hundred times more careful than usual! There is nothing more dangerous than a cornered animal!
Don't give them an inch!
It's vital that we get away and survive!
I know we can win this-together.
We have to get moving or we won't make it in time!
Go for glory!
Understood. Let's go!
Now for the victory feast, hehehe.
They didn't break through!
I'm relieved we didn't get caught.
Let's just be glad we survived.
If we can carry on reclaiming land like this, we won't have any more food worries!
This mission is a mess. Let's retreat.
How could this have happened?
Great! We can't lose!
This can't be. We're getting battered!
Let's give this mission everything we've got!
Okay, advancing!
We need to support them!
Saving them is our number one priority!
Make our defenses as strong as the Wall!
Time to rendezvous!
Advance!
Provide support!
We have to help them! Lend a hand!
Hold your ground, guys!
Yes! Mission complete!
It looks like we've failed!
Aborting mission!
I have a good feeling about today!
This is scary. I want to go back to my village.
We'll take back our land and feast! Bring on the MEAT, bwahaha!
I've contributed enough to mankind's struggle. I think it's high time I graduated from the title of "potato girl."
There's no etiquette when it comes to taking down your prey.
If you underestimate the forest, you'll die! I suppose it's only people who grew up hunting who understand that.
I thought I'd be able to try all sorts of tasty food after leaving my village, but it's been a little disappointing.
