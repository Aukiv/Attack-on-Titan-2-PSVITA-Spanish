Maybe this'll get everyone to quit saying I got into the MP unfairly, hm?
Hey, why am I the one doing all the work?
That was TOO close! Why are they pitting me against the scary ones?
I thought I was a goner! What kind of Titan was that?
Are you crazy?! I can't beat this thing!
Is that an...Abnormal?
The color of that smoke... Isn't it a distress call?
That signal means things are going south, right?
You came along at just the right time.
Sooooo sorry for the trouble. Won't happen again!
Let me guess, [0:HERO_FAMN]. You want to be my friend?
You again, [0:HERO_FSTN]? You're nice. Maybe too nice.
You saved my life again, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Thanks. I'm glad we're friends.
Huh? What are you talking about? I just happened to be passing by.
Not at all. It actually looks like I got in your way.
What's with that look? Mad at me for making you work more?
Thanks, Marlo. I guess you're more than just a mouth.
Wow, saved by the commander. Does MP corruption only run in the lower ranks?


Don't mention it. Only the cream of the crop gets into the Military Police, right?
Well, I certainly can't let YOU die. Who would I have to laugh at?
...Maybe I should throw you back to the Titans.
But of course, sir. The MP has an eye for talent-and it's talent I have. Yep...

Wow, you're amazing.
Wow. I must say, I'm very impressed.
Yeah, that's amazing and all-but personally, I'd rather not try that hard.
You're good, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I'll give you that. Not that I want to BE like you, I'm just saying.
You really put slackers like me to shame, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Eh, almost.
You're gloomy and well, kind of rude-but talented!
Keep it up, Marlo! You know, so I don't have to.
Wow, Commander! You're soooo strong!
Are all the southern Cadet Corps graduates whiz kids like you?
Incredible, sir! But personally...if I made it to Premier, I'd never set foot on the front lines again.
I can't believe you're still alive after taking on a Titan like that.
I can't believe you killed it. It must be tough being such a big shot.
You beat THAT? What the heck are you, [0:HERO_FSTN]?
I'm not sure which was scarier, the Titan or you.
I have a fab idea, [0:HERO_FSTN]. Stick by me-and protect me from those things, 'kay?
I can't handle this. Someone, help me.
Help! Please!
Isn't there anyone else around?
Why did I bother joining the Military Police?
Tell me this is a dream. I might actually die...!
Help me! I'll do anything!
You look wrecked.
I can't just ignore it... Crap!
I'm glad we're both still alive.
Are you hurt?
Huh? I'm fine.
Yeah, by some miracle.
Sorry... I'm done for.
My mission ends here!
Well? I'm here.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Let battle commence! Huh? Why am I saying that?
How can I get out of this?
We can't win this. Why bother fighting?
Guess I have to help out.
I'm not letting you get away!
So, we stop the Titans-or we all die. Got it.
I've gotta move my ass! The Titans are almost right on top of us!
Even I'm gonna pull out all the stops. It is the last time after all.
We ain't got time for chit-chat.
Woohoo!
Yes!
We won? I don't believe it.
We held out... Phew!
Have they stopped chasing us? My legs are killing me.
I hate it when things turn out like this.
It's over...for good this time.
No way? That can't be right.
Sorry... I failed.
This one's in the bag if we carry on like this!
We can't win this. Why even try?
Okay, let's get this party started.
I guess I'm gonna advance.
They're just gonna ask for help anyway, right?
I can't just not help them, can I?
I'm not sure I'll be able to hold out, but I'll try to defend the area.
I should be safe if I stick with them.
Advance!
Support them!
Save our comrades!
Defend that area!
Mission complete!
How could we have failed the mission?
The best laid plans...
Sometimes even I can get serious!
It might be time for me to tap out of this.
The Military Police is rotten to the core. Works for me-that's why I joined.
Those Scouts sure like to play hero.
I didn't become a soldier to scrap with Titans.
My reason for joining the Military Police? Whatever, let them gossip.
I'm beat. I just wanna get this over and done with.
