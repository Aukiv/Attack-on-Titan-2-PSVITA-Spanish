I need members of all Regiments to do their jobs properly.





Huh...that smoke... What it it?
Could it be that they are in trouble?
Thank you. I am most grateful.

What a nice child. You did a great job keeping me safe!














Marvelous.

You're strong despite your age.


That was magnificent, Commander Erwin. You deserve better than the Scout Regiment.




I never knew Titans such as that even existed.

You must be the strongest soldier of all humanity...wait, you're not?


















Let's start the proceedings.










Victory for humanity.








It is vital that this mission is a success.





Please advance.
Please support your comrades.
You need to save your comrades.
Please defend that area at all cost.
The mission went like a dream.
What is the meaning of this? How could you have failed the mission?
The mission is no longer viable. Aborting.


I have no desire to see the world outside the Walls.
I need members of all Regiments to do their jobs properly.
