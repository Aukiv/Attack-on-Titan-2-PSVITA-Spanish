You think I'm just gonna let myself get eaten...?

We won... That was pretty rough...

That looks formidable.
An Abnormal...? This isn't gonna be easy.
A distress call... I'll go.
This is gonna be tough...
Thanks.
Thank you.



Don't let your guard down yet.
Be careful...










Not bad.
Impressive.








Defeating such a powerful enemy... Astounding.
You're an example I wish to follow.



Sorry, can you lend a hand?
Sorry, I screwed up.
Hang on. I'll be right there.
I'm coming.
My eyes are blurry...
It looks like this is curtains for me.
Don't die on me!
I'll get to you in time!
You okay?
Are you okay?
Fine.
I'm fine.
Retreating.
It's about time. Fall back.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Starting the mission.
Everyone, engage at will.
We will get ourselves out of this.
I'll help you!
Do not let them escape!
I will hold this ground!
The situation is dire... Retreat.
It's time to end this once and for all!
We don't have time. Hurry.
Got it.
Understood.
We won.
It seems we managed to hold our ground.
Did we all manage to escape?
This victory should prepare us for the next step...
Yeah, victory for humankind!
Mission failed... Isn't there any way to carry on fighting?
So am I to be eaten?
Our comrades are all over them.
This is gonna be tough...
Starting the mission.
I'm going out in front.
I'll support our comrades.
I'm going to save our comrades.
I'll defend the area.
I'm teaming up.
Advance.
Support our comrades.
Save our comrades.
Defend that area.
It seems the operation went smoothly.
We've failed our mission.
We can no longer continue. Aborting mission.
I must do my duty!
I don't stand a chance after all...
