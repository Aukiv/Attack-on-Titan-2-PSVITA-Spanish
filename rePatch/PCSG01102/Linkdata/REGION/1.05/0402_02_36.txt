You'll never get me, you big idiot!
No way I'm gonna get eaten by you!
Not bad, but definitely no match for me.
It'll take more than that to stop me! That's just how I fight!
That thing looks pretty tough...
Don't tell me it's an Abnormal!
Looks like they're in trouble... I'd better get over there.
Things aren't looking very good over there...
Thanks, that was a tough fight...
Sorry you had to come to my rescue...
I didn't expect to get help from a new soldier like you, [0:HERO_FAMN]...
Thanks for the help. I owe you one, [0:HERO_FSTN].
Sorry to pull you into this, [0:HERO_FSTN]! Next time I'll be the one to help you!
Don't be so careless, alright?
We can't have you dying, not like this.
Miche, thanks a lot! You're so talented!
You saved me, Nanaba! I knew I could count on you.
Sorry about that, Conny! I didn't expect you to pull through for me!
Thanks for the help... You're gonna make a fine soldier.

It was worth putting my life on the line if it helped you, Miche!
Don't worry about it, Nanaba. We're always helping each other, right?
No need to be humble, Garrison soldier! You're not bad, you know that?


Nice movement! You've got it!
Awesome! I'll follow your lead!
[0:HERO_FAMN]! I like your style!
[0:HERO_FSTN]! Your movement is great, just as always!
[0:HERO_FSTN]! You've gotten even better, haven't you?
Good one, Miche! You really are humanity's second strongest soldier after Levi!
Good one, Nanaba! You're as skilled as ever!
Geez, Conny! Are you a genius or something?
I thought you were arrogant at first...but it looks like you really do know what you're doing.
Nice one... Must be thanks to Commander Hange's training.
Woah, you beat that thing?!
You did it! That makes things a lot easier.
Amazing, [0:HERO_FAMN]! That was incredible!
[0:HERO_FAMN], I never thought I'd be surpassed by a new soldier like you!
Great show, [0:HERO_FAMN]! I knew you'd come out on top!
Hey, a little help over here!
Ugh... Can somebody help me out?
Hang on, I'm coming!
Got it! I'm on the way!
Sorry...but this is all I got...
I'm sorry... I can't go any further...
Hang in there! Don't give up yet!
This isn't good... If we don't hurry we're screwed...!
Feeling better now?
How do you feel now?
I can still fight! Just watch!
I've got plenty of strength left! Let's go!
Damn it... I can't go on...
That's enough... I'm gonna pull back.
I know I'm off to a late start, but I'll make up for it with all the enemies I defeat!
The fighting's not over yet, right?
Time to fight!
I have to win here...or I'll never have another drink.
This isn't enough to scare me...
Our comrades are waiting...hurry!
Hold it right there...! We're not just gonna let you run away!
We can't avoid this fight. We have to hold our ground at all costs!
There's nothing else we can do here. Retreat!
Let's finish this once and for all...!
We've gotta take care of them before it's too late!
We can do this!
Roger that! I'll give it everything I've got!
It's over...and we won.
They're all gone... We held our ground.
We shook them off... Not bad.
I'll hold off on the victory toast for now...
We win... Humanity wins!
We have to retreat...? I guess the mission failed...
This has to be...a joke...
I think we can pull through...
Things aren't looking good... We'd better figure something out fast...
Time to get started.
I'll go in front!
I'll keep our comrades safe!
I'll rescue our comrades!
I'll focus on defending this spot!
I should team up with other soldiers...
Alright, charge!
Protect our comrades!
Help rescue them!
I need you on defense!
That went well! Mission accomplished!
Damn it... We failed...
This is not good... Abort mission!
I'm not messing around... I'm not messing around anymore!
It's all over now...
I'd do anything for a drink...
New soldiers just don't have the experience... Guess I'll have to do this on my own...
I've survived in the Scout Regiment for years. No way I'm dying now...
I kill Titans however I want...
Omni-directional mobility gear lets us chose where we fight... So I like to choose the most advantageous position possible.
