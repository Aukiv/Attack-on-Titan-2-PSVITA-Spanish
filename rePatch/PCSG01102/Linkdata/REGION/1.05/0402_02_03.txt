I can fight too, you know!
Now I'm the one protecting other people!
Talk about a close shave! Just how did we get out of that, again?
That was tough! Luckily I'm still in one piece.
What type of Titan is that?! It looks dangerous.
There's no mistaking it... It's an Abnormal!
A distress call!
Things aren't looking good for our friends.
Sorry to trouble you.
I appreciate your help!
You came for me, [0:HERO_FAMN]! Thanks.
Seeing you does wonders for my jitters, [0:HERO_FSTN]!
We're sure to turn the tables with you here, [0:HERO_FSTN]!
I'm just glad I could be of help!
I'm honored I could be of help!
Thanks, Eren. You're always there for me.
Dependable as always, Mikasa! Thanks.
Right on time, Mr. Hannes! Looks like I'm still in the fight!
Wow, Annie, thanks! I guess you do care!
Much obliged, Commander. Sorry for the trouble!
Aw, I'll be fine. The important thing is that you're okay.
Don't you worry about me, Mikasa. I'm right as rain.
Appreciate the concern, Mr. Hannes, but I've toughened up over the years. Really!
Heheh... Call it a fluke, I guess.
R-really? I'm flattered.
That's amazing.
I need to learn how to fight like that.
Incredible, [0:HERO_FAMN]! Keep at it!
Wow, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I really should be taking notes.
Now that's the [0:HERO_FSTN] I know. Glad you're on our side!
Amazing, Eren! I'd better start hustling too.
Ever the speedster, Mikasa. I can hardly keep up!
I can tell someone's having a good day, Jean! Nice moves.
Looking good out there, Christa. Angelic, even!
You're our rock, Reiner. Solid and strong.
You're so strong! You killed it.
I guess that's what you can do with experience!
Talk about heroic, [0:HERO_FAMN]. You're on fire!
I can't help but envy you, [0:HERO_FSTN]. I better practice up!
Amazing. You get better with each battle, [0:HERO_FSTN]!
Not good... Someone back me up!
Give me a hand!
I'm coming to help!
Got it! I'm on my way!
I'm in over my head. Help, someone!
I'm a goner. I need help!
I can't let any more of my comrades die. I have to help!
This won't end well. I'd better help!
Phew... Are you all right?
Armin Arlert here! Are you okay?
I'm fine! I won't get in your way.
It's inspiring to team up with a veteran like you.
I don't stand a chance.
It's time to pull out!
Arlert here, coming to help!
I've got your backs!
I won't get in the way!
Guys, don't leave me behind!
This is bad. Do I have what it takes?
I can help. Just hold on!
Don't let them get away!
I'll stand fast, at any cost!
This is not a good situation... Run for it!
We must win, whatever it takes!
We have to get this done before we run out of time!
I'm coming, too!
Let's go!
Mankind is victorious!
We held our ground... We won!
We just managed to get away.
That could've gone better, but we did it.
Victory for humankind! And I played a part!
Mission failed!
I just couldn't struggle on any longer.
This is going great! Keep it up!
This isn't going well for us!
This mission can succeed. I know it!
Advance!
I can't do it alone... Support them!
We have to help them, whatever it takes!
I have to stand my ground!
Right, time to team up!
Everyone, advance!
Everyone, help them!
We've gotta save them... Help me!
We have to keep them at bay!
Yeah, we did great!
It's no good... We've failed!
We don't stand a chance at this rate!
I'd rather die than become a burden!
I can't go on any longer.
If there's one thing I'm NOT becoming-it's Titan fodder.
I'm not here to hold anyone back. Not on my life. You'll see I'm worth my salt.
Someday, I'll see the ocean.
I may not be very strong, but I can't stand idly by and do nothing.
Eren and Mikasa are always helping me. Our friendship isn't equal.
